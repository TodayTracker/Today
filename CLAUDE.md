# Today (formerly Life OS) — Project Memory

## What this is
A personal productivity mobile web app consolidating habit tracking, goals,
vision board, and app blocker. Deployed at todaytracker.github.io/Today
(GitHub user TodayTracker, repo Today — renamed in 4.3 from
king83853/LifeOS; the old address is gone, GitHub Pages doesn't redirect).

## Stack (keep this accurate — update when it changes)
- Single-file HTML/JS/CSS app (no build step, no bundler)
- Persistence: browser localStorage (no backend yet)
- Deployment: GitHub Pages, static hosting
- Target: mobile web (primary interaction is touch/swipe, not mouse)

## Working agreement for this file
- Update the "Known gotchas" and "Decisions" sections whenever something is
  learned the hard way — a bug that wasted time, an approach that seemed
  right but broke things, a UI change that cascaded into other breakage.
- Before starting a new feature, re-read this file. Don't re-litigate
  decisions already made below.

## Decisions made (don't redo these debates)
- NAME (4.3): the app is called "Today" on screen (manifest name/short_name,
  <title>, apple-mobile-web-app-title — the home-screen label is fixed when
  an icon is ADDED, so rename before people add it). Internal names keep
  "lifeos" ON PURPOSE: the localStorage key 'lifeos' (changing it = every
  user's data looks gone), 'lifeos-*' side keys, the 'lifeos-cache-v…'
  CACHE_NAME prefix, the export tags LOS1/2/3. Texts that named the app
  were reworded to "this app"/"The app". Moving users to the new address =
  Export in the OLD icon → Add to Home Screen from the new link → Import in
  the NEW icon (each icon has its own storage). The old icon keeps opening
  from its cache after the old address 404s: its update check fails
  quietly (reg.update() rejects → catch → silent) and never reaches
  _hardUpdate, so nothing destructive happens — checked for 4.3.
- `Nav.sd` (Daily tab's selected-day state) is an absolute day OFFSET from
  today (0 = today, negative = past, positive = future) — NOT a weekday
  index 0-6. It used to be a weekday index back when the day strip only
  ever showed the current week (index doubled as both "which pill" and
  "which weekday, for recurring-schedule matching"). Extending the strip
  to DAILY_RANGE_BACK/DAILY_RANGE_FWD (buildPills/buildPanels) split those
  two meanings apart: the offset drives `pDate(pi)` — now literally
  `T + pi days`, nothing more — while a separate `wIdx(dateObj)` call
  gives the real weekday for matching `item.days`. `pDate` used to be
  `T.getDate()-TI+pi` (this week's Monday + pi) from when pi was a
  weekday index; that formula only gives the right date when pi equals
  TI, i.e. it silently only looked correct on the exact day it was
  tested. Shipped this way once, only caught it from a real bug report
  ("today" pill landing on Monday's date on any non-Monday) — verify
  `pDate(0)` against the actual wall-clock date directly next time, not
  just relative differences between two pDate() calls (which stay
  linear-correct either way and don't catch an anchor-point bug at all).
  If you touch this area
  again: recurring items are scheduled by weekday and apply every week —
  don't reintroduce a index-is-both-things assumption.
  There was a SECOND leftover call site of the same bug, found later:
  Today's own habit checkboxes (`renderToday()`, via `ci(it.id,it.text,TI)`)
  were still passing the weekday index `TI` as if it were a day-offset
  into `pDate`/`toggleDailyItemFor`, so ticking a habit in Today wrote the
  checkmark under `pDate(TI)` (today + TI days — some other date) while
  the read path correctly used `pDate(0)` (today) — checkbox looked
  checked until the next re-render, then reverted. Fixed by passing `0`.
  Lesson: when a function's parameter meaning changes (weekday index →
  day offset), grep every call site, not just the ones in the feature you
  were actively changing at the time — this one shipped for a whole
  session before a bug report caught it.

- SEVERAL Habits projects (3.77, "create 2 different habit projects without
  them interfering"): every habit (dailyItems entry) has `pid` = the Habits
  project it belongs to; `DB._migrate` gives old habits `habitsProjectId`.
  Read it through `habitPid(it)` (a missing project falls back to the first
  one, `mainHabitsPid()`), test projects with `isHabitsProject(pid)` (type
  'daily' or the old habitsProjectId), list them with `habitsProjects()`
  (Overview order). There is still ONE Daily page (#p-habits): Nav.go on any
  Habits project sets `Habits.pid` and opens it; `curHabitsPid()` is what it
  shows (title, title-button editor, buildPanels' filter, where new habits
  and tracker links go). Calendar tasks (dailyOnce) belong to no project
  and, since 4.6 ("detach calendar tasks from habit projects, that makes no
  sense"), are NOT on Habits pages at all: not in the day panels, not in
  the Habits "+" (Repeating task / Track a project only), not in a Habits
  card's count on Overview. They're added from Overview's "+" (Category /
  Project / Calendar -> OnceAddSheet) and show only in Today (overdue ones
  roll into today) and Tasks > Calendar. Before 4.6 they showed on every
  Habits page and counted on every Habits card. Today has
  one card per Habits project, titled with its name. `habitsProjectId`
  stays as the FIRST/main one: creating another Habits project no longer
  takes it over (it did — every habit was global, so a second one showed
  the same habits), and its editor still hides Delete. Other Habits projects
  can be deleted: their habits go to the Trash one by one (DB.deleteProject);
  "Reset a project" on one trashes only its habits (categories stay). A
  restored habit whose project is gone shows under the first one, and moves
  back if that project is restored. Anything new that lists or counts habits
  must filter by habitPid — don't treat dailyItems as one global list.
- CATEGORIES ARE OPTIONAL (4.14, "strictly a visual feature… projects
  don't need one; the ones without a category go on top"): a project with
  no category lives in `projectOrder[NO_CAT]` (NO_CAT = '_none'), never in
  `categories`/`categoryOrder`; `p.categoryId` is '_none'. Everything that
  works per category key (addProject, deleteProject, moveProject,
  reorderProjects, restore) just works with it; restoreTrash's ensureCat
  only recreates the '_none' array (never a "Restored" category). Lists
  in Overview order use `projectGroups()` = [NO_CAT, ...categoryOrder]
  (habitsProjects, Menu > Overview > Reset a project). Overview draws them
  first as `.nocat-block` (no title, NOT a `.cat-block`, so a dragged
  category can't be dropped above it);
  `projCard(pid)` builds one card for both. Edit layout lists them first
  under "No category" (`elProjRow`). New project: Category row defaults
  to None (`SheetEditor.catOpts()`), and A.newProject no longer forces a
  category first. Deleting a CATEGORY still sends its projects to the
  Trash (unchanged — not asked). Editing a project still can't change
  its category (the Category row is new-project only). Export keeps the
  '_none' key as is (`_shortIds` doesn't touch it). Spacing: the loose
  grid sits 20px under a visible War Room (`#war-box:not([style*=
  "none"])+#overview-grid>.nocat-block:first-child>.agrid` -2px).
- The Daily project is a real entry in `DB.data.projects` (with its own
  name/icon/color/desc, editable through the normal SheetEditor sheet)
  but it never lives at its own page id — `Nav.go` redirects
  `habitsProjectId` to the static `#p-habits` page, so `#p-<pid>` for
  the Daily project's id is dead markup that's built but never shown.
  Two consequences worth remembering if this area changes again: (1)
  don't check `p.type==='daily'` alone to detect "is this the Daily
  project" — real data can have that project's `type` left as something
  else (e.g. `'todo'`) with only `habitsProjectId` actually pointing at
  it, so check `pid===DB.data.habitsProjectId` too (bit the Overview
  card count for exactly this reason). (2) Any code that updates a
  project's header after an edit by querying `#p-<pid> ...` (SheetEditor
  .save()) silently no-ops for the Daily project — it needs an explicit
  extra branch to update `#habits-dtitle` instead.

- A `dailyItems` entry now has two distinct shapes, both handled through
  the same array/schedule machinery (`days`, category, buildPanels' day
  panels, Today's list) but rendered and "is it done" differently: a
  normal habit has its own `text` and is a boolean check-off
  (`dailyChecks`), rendered via `ci()`/`ciEdit()`; a tracker-linked item
  (`addTrackerDailyItem`) has `trackerPid` instead of `text` and no
  boolean state of its own at all — its day value is whatever
  `trackerDayValue(it, ds)` finds in that project's OWN `trackerEntries`
  (and "done" is `habitDayVal`, below), rendered via `ciTracker()` (a
  number box in the tick zone since 2.92; the bar opens the tracker's
  own project page). Its name/icon
  are read from `DB.data.projects[trackerPid]` live on every render,
  never copied into the dailyItems entry, so renaming the tracker can't
  leave a stale label sitting in Daily.
  Since 2.92 there is ONE answer to "is this habit done on day ds":
  `habitDayVal(it,ds)` (falsy / true / 'skip'). A normal habit is its
  check-off (`dcv`); a tracker habit is done when that day's value
  reaches `it.goal` (optional number on the dailyItems entry, set in the
  habit sheet), or with no goal when anything was logged that day, and
  otherwise can be 'skip' (swipe on Today, stored in dailyChecks like any
  habit; saving a value clears it). EVERY score/streak/bar/count/
  disappear check goes through it — use it for any new one; don't
  re-branch on `it.trackerPid`. That's the history of this area: first
  Overview's count missed trackers (only checked `isDailyChecked`), then
  Statistics excluded trackers entirely ("a logged number isn't a
  check-off") — reversed in 2.92 at the user's request: tracker habits
  now count in Stats, best/worst use `habitName(it)` (a tracker entry has
  no `text`).
  Statistics reset (`DB.resetHabitStats`) covers tracker habits too since
  2.94 (it used to skip them, so their history kept counting): like any
  habit, `created`=today (since 3.74 a reset habit simply isn't shown on
  Daily's earlier days, like a new habit — "gone in the past, showing in the
  present"; before that it showed there dimmed with a lock, and `wasReset`
  flagged it — that flag, LOCK_SVG, the `locked` params of ciEdit/ciTracker
  and `.cali.locked` are gone; a category left empty that day says "No
  habits"), and additionally
  `it.statsFrom`=now, because the tracker's entries are KEPT (they're the
  tracker's own data) and some may be from earlier today. The habit reads
  its day value only through `trackerDayValue(it,ds)` (latest entry that
  day with ts >= statsFrom) — `trackerEntryForDate` is gone — and
  `setTrackerDayValue(pid,ds,val,from)` never edits a pre-reset entry, it
  adds a new one instead. The tracker page's own chart/entries list still
  shows every entry.
  Tracker habit rows (`ciTracker`, Today and Daily) are split rows like
  habits. Since 3.13 the tick zone holds the SAME checkbox as a habit
  (checked = `habitDayVal` done, row `.skipped` when skipped, label struck
  through/dimmed like `paintCheck` — rendered inline, the checkbox has no
  `data-id` so restoreChecks/Today's painter, which read dailyChecks, leave
  it alone; its click is preventDefault()ed so it never toggles), and the
  day's value + unit sits in front of the arrow as `.cali-val` (Settings'
  row-value style, part of the bar). 2.92–3.12 showed the value INSIDE a
  number box (`.trk-box`) instead — replaced by request. A tap on the box
  (a hold, in hold-to-complete mode — the HOLD handler's
  `[data-tracker]` branch) opens `TrackerDaySheet`, which SETS that day's value
  (`DB.setTrackerDayValue`: changes that day's latest entry or adds one
  timestamped on that day) so adjusting through the day doesn't pile up
  entries; future days can't be logged. The bar opens the tracker page.
  A tap/hold on a SKIPPED tracker's box un-skips it (3.32,
  `TrackerDaySheet.press`) like a habit's box does, instead of opening the
  value window (which forced entering a number just to un-skip).
  The old inline trash icon on Daily's tracker rows is gone — delete is in
  the habit sheet now (openEdit shows Delete for trackers too), reached
  by tapping the days line under the tracker page's title (3.90 — it was
  a "Daily habit" card with Days/Goal rows, removed by request: the goal
  shows as the chart's goal line, and the days sit under the title like on
  a habit page; `#hsub-<pid>` in buildProjPages' header, filled/hidden by
  renderTracker). That line is the only way from the tracker page to the
  habit's days/delete — keep it tappable. The GOAL is also editable in the
  project's own edit window (SheetEditor, tap the name; `#sheet-goal-row`,
  shown only for a tracker added as a habit, writes the habit's `goal`) —
  3.92, after 3.90 read "remove the goal widget" as the Days/Goal card and
  the user then missed the goal setting there ("only meant to be removed
  in the project tab, not the project edit tab"). Keep both places.
  A tracker page for a Daily-linked tracker (`renderTracker` +
  `TrackerPage`): entries fold behind one "Entries N ›" row (closed by
  default, state kept per pid while the app runs), then the Consistency
  ring and Longest streak (days: under the title since 3.90). (Its done/not-done habit bar chart
  was removed in 3.89 by request — the tracker's own chart shows the
  values; see "Tracker charts".)

- Habit consistency scores (`habitConsistency`, and the Statistics tab's
  ring/best/worst built on it) count only days ON OR AFTER the habit was
  created, over at most the last 90 days: score = scheduled days
  completed / scheduled days elapsed, today counted only once checked.
  Creation date is `it.created` (new items) or, for older ones, parsed
  from the id (`'di'+Date.now()+random`, see `habitCreatedDs`) — nothing
  needed migrating. It used to divide by a fixed ~90-day target, so a
  habit added yesterday scored ~1% against months it didn't exist. Items
  with target 0 (brand-new, nothing to judge yet) are skipped by
  best/worst. The bar charts skip pre-creation days too. If you add
  another place that counts "scheduled days" for a habit, use
  `habitCreatedDs`.
  3.25: the Statistics RING (`aggHabitConsistency` ->
  `habitConsistency(it,true)`) also counts today's scheduled habits before
  they're ticked — asked for as "0 / x" right after a statistics reset
  (it said nothing, since today only counted once ticked), rising 1 / x,
  2 / x as you tick. A single habit's score (best/worst, habit page) keeps
  counting today only once ticked, so it doesn't dip every morning.
  3.54: Settings > Statistics > Time range (`settings.statsRange`: 'all' /
  '3m' / '1m' / '1w' = `STATS_RANGES` 0/90/30/7 days, default '3m' = the old
  fixed 90 days; read via `statsRange()`, which falls back to '3m') sets how
  far back the Statistics RING looks — asked for as a setting "for the pie
  chart", so only `aggHabitConsistency` passes it (`habitConsistency(it,
  true,span)`); best/worst and a habit's own page keep 90 days. All time
  starts at `habitCreatedDs` (so after a statistics reset, at the reset).
  3.86: Menu > Statistics > Widgets — a switch per Statistics widget
  (`STAT_WIDGETS`: score, chart, best, worst; `settings.statsHidden` lists
  the switched-off ones, default none). Each widget on #p-stats is wrapped
  in `.stat-w[data-w]`; `Stats.applyWidgets()` toggles `.off` and shows
  "All widgets are turned off" when none is left; a hidden widget isn't
  rendered (a hidden chart can't measure itself). The 20px card-after-card
  rule skips a switched-off wrapper (`:not(.off)+*`), so the widget after it
  keeps normal spacing — measured 20 / 44px gaps in every combination.
  3.87: the widgets can be REORDERED by holding one (DragReorder on #p-stats,
  wired once via dataset.dragWired, list mode; `settings.statsOrder`, default
  score/chart/best/worst, read via `Stats.order()`; Menu > Statistics lists
  the switches in that order). Because a picked-up element becomes
  position:fixed (its own formatting context), a widget whose title margin
  collapsed through its wrapper jumped when lifted — so each `.stat-w` is
  now `display:flow-root` with its own margins (0 0 22px, `.after-card`
  -2px for a card-first widget below another, set in applyWidgets), inner
  margins zeroed. Default layout measured pixel-identical to before. Careful:
  that flow-root rule outranks a plain `.stat-w.off{display:none}` — the
  hide rule must be at least as specific (it wasn't, hidden widgets kept
  their space for one build). DragReorder's placeholder now copies the
  item's vertical margins, and in 'list' mode only the finger's up/down
  position decides a swap (the middle-60% check sideways made a hold near a
  row's left edge never swap — Daily habits too).
  4.9: holding a widget on #p-stats NO LONGER moves it (by request —
  "instead add a separate page in settings like we have for overview"):
  the DragReorder on #p-stats, its `.stat-w.dragging` CSS and ZChart's
  DragReorder.active check are gone. Order is changed on Menu > Statistics
  > Edit layout (`#p-statslayout`, `renderStatsLayout`, up/down `.el-btn`s
  like Overview's Edit layout, `A.moveStatWidget(k,dir)` swaps in
  `Stats.order()` and saves statsOrder). The flow-root `.stat-w` layout
  stays (pixel-identical, harmless). 4.11: the page lists only widgets
  that are turned on ("All widgets are turned off" when none); a move
  swaps with the next VISIBLE widget, hidden ones keep their slot in
  statsOrder.
  3.88: 5th widget "Perfect streak" (`perfect`, last by default): current
  run of days on which EVERY habit scheduled that day, across all Habits
  projects, was done (`perfectStreaks()`; skip = done; a day with nothing
  scheduled — rest day or before any habit existed — neither counts nor
  breaks it; an unfinished today doesn't break it; a tracker habit whose
  tracker project is gone is left out, since it can never be done), with
  "Longest streak: N" under it — the habit page's streak card pattern, but
  the CURRENT streak is the big number here ("the streak" was asked for).
  Adding a widget = markup `.stat-w[data-w]` + STAT_WIDGETS + render branch
  + DEFAULT_SETTINGS.statsOrder; `Stats.order()` appends it for people who
  already reordered.
  Dropdown setters must call `renderSettings()` — customSelect is static
  markup, and without a redraw the row kept showing the old value.
  Bar charts (`ZChart`, shared by Statistics and habit pages — tracker pages
  had one too until 3.89) have
  a slim left axis with ONE number — the tallest bar's value, at its
  height (by request: "don't put all the numbers"); since 4.2 that's the
  tallest bar of either colour.
  4.2 bar look: every column is a GREY bar as tall as the habits scheduled
  in it (`hd-bar-empty` class, has data-i so a tap shows the readout), the
  done part in green (skipped light green) grows up inside it from the
  bottom; a column with no habits (before any existed, or none scheduled)
  is a low 3px grey stripe (no data-i). The dashed "100%" line on top
  (1.84–4.1, `.hd-goal-line`) is gone — the grey bar replaced it. render
  now draws EVERY visible column (i1 = ceil(offset+count), no longer
  clamped to maxIdx), so days older than the first habit get the stripe
  too; scrolling still stops at the oldest data (_maxOff).
  3.72 — the charts zoom and scroll ("like TradingView"), replacing the
  Day/Week/Month buttons (and renderBarChart/habitPeriods/aggHabitPeriods):
  pinch = zoom over a span of time `D` (calendar days); columns are days up
  to ZC_DAY_MAX (45) on screen, then weeks up to ZC_WEEK_MAX (26), then
  months (≤60); min 7 columns, default 14 days; zoom-out capped a little past
  the data (always ≥ a year since 4.26). Sideways drag = scroll back in time, with a
  fling, settling on whole columns; clamped at today and the oldest data.
  The right edge stays put in time while zooming. A small grey label (Days/
  Weeks/Months) sits where the buttons were; a tap still shows the readout
  (`barReadout` uses the period's `title`). `chartSource(item|null)` gives
  one cached period at a time (`period(gran,idx)`, idx back from now);
  one habit's day columns are its scheduled days only (`dayLen` = 7/k
  calendar days each), Statistics' are calendar days. `.zchart` has
  touch-action:pan-y (vertical drags scroll the page; horizontal and pinch
  are the chart's), iOS `gesturestart` is prevented (no page zoom), and the
  swipe-back ignores touches that start on a chart. `zChart(hostId,...)`
  keeps one ZChart per host element (`host._zc`), so Statistics' persistent
  host isn't wired again on every visit (the Overview duplicate-listener
  lesson); every visit resets the view to the last 14 days. Hidden features
  has a tip for it.
  4.26 ("pinching never changes the duration of one bar… taking way too
  long, not smooth, can't get monthly bars"): (1) render() replaces the
  whole svg every frame, and a touch keeps targeting the element it STARTED
  on — on iOS, once that rect/svg is gone the rest of the gesture goes to
  the removed node and never bubbles to the host's listeners (MDN: attach
  listeners to the target, or keep it in the document). Each pinch zoomed
  about one frame, then nothing; touchend never arrived either, so mode
  stayed 3. Fix: `.zchart svg{pointer-events:none}` → the host is always
  the target; a tap finds its bar by x (`_step`, `_padL`, offset) instead
  of `rect[data-i]`. Synthetic events dispatched on the host (how 3.72 was
  tested) can't show this — dispatch on `document.elementFromPoint(x,y)`
  like a real finger. Anything that redraws its own content under a finger
  needs the same. (2) Dmax was "a little past the data, at least 12 weeks":
  with little history, months (D > 182) were unreachable; now at least
  `ZC_OUT_MIN` 366 days (12 monthly bars, empty ones as stripes). (3) pinch
  = span x (finger distance ratio)^`ZC_PINCH` 1.5 (was 1:1), so one pinch
  goes days → weeks → months. Measured in the preview with finger-targeted
  touches: one pinch 14d → 366d (Months), back in to 7d, drag + fling fine.

- Swipe-right-to-skip on Today (`Skip`, `swipeWrap`; rows are wrapped in
  `.sw` with the amber action behind `.sw-row`). Two different data
  shapes on purpose: a skipped TASK gets `t.skip = 'YYYY-MM-DD'` and is
  just filtered out of Today for that one day (nothing to clean up — it
  returns by itself tomorrow, sorted first within its priority — unless
  Settings > Today > "Reset skipped tasks every new day"
  (`settings.skipResetDaily`, 3.43, default on) is off: then any `t.skip`
  keeps it out of Today until "Reset skipped tasks" clears it); with
  "Refill automatically" on Today re-renders so the next task fills in,
  off it just removes the row (same as completing one). A skipped HABIT
  day is stored in `dailyChecks[ds][id]` as the string `'skip'` instead of
  `true` — deliberately truthy, so every existing "is it done" check
  (score, streak, remaining count, disappear-when-checked) counts it as
  done with zero changes; read it with `dcv(ds,id)==='skip'` where the
  difference matters (light-green bars in the charts (`ZChart`), `paintCheck`, the
  "· N skipped" captions). A skipped habit ROW shows it only through its tick box
  (skip style) and a dimmed name — the " · skipped" text after the name
  (`.cali.skipped label::after`) was removed in 3.26 as redundant. Since 3.35 a
  skipped row looks like a done one (name struck through at .35 opacity —
  `paintCheck` and `ciTracker`) EXCEPT its box, which keeps the skip look:
  light `--go-skip` green with the arrow ("icon" to the user means the
  box's color too — 3.35 briefly made it the done green). Charts/ring still use
  the light skip green to tell them apart. Any new code that reads dailyChecks should use
  `dcv`/`paintCheck` rather than assuming a boolean, and any wrapper
  around Today rows means `.remove()` calls must remove the `.sw`, not
  just the inner row (see `A.doneLockedIn`).
  3.81 ("skip habits inside the projects… from the past in case I was
  sick"): a Habits project's day panels (buildPanels) wrap every habit row
  in `swipeWrap('h',row,true)` — `always`, so Menu > Today > Skip habits
  (Today's switch) doesn't turn it off there. `Skip.go` skips the ROW's own
  day (`data-day` on the tracker `.cali` or the habit's checkbox → pDate),
  so any shown day works, past or future; then rebuilds the panels
  (buildPanels + restoreChecks) and Today. Un-skipping is the same as
  before: tap the box. Because rows are wrapped there now, Daily's
  DragReorder picks up `.sw.h` (itemSel), not `.cali` — DragReorder swaps
  DIRECT children of the container, so whatever wraps a row is what must
  move. No conflict with the edge swipe-back: it starts at x<=35, which is
  inside the tick zone, where a skip swipe never starts.
  4.23 ("the same animation as skipped tasks"): on Today with "Habits
  disappear when checked off" on, a skipped habit leaves through the same
  `slideOut(w,done)` as a skipped task (slide right .2s, then max-height
  fold .18s, then remove + `_dropEmptyCard` for an emptied card/title)
  instead of springing back and vanishing on renderToday. When it stays
  visible (that switch off, or a Habits project's panels) it still springs
  back — the row remains, shown as skipped.

- Today's ORDER (4.11, "an edit tab to edit the order of today: tasks,
  calendar, habits"): #p-today holds three `.today-sec[data-s]` blocks —
  tasks (the Tasks title + #today-priorities), calendar (`#today-cal`, own
  container since 4.11; it used to be the top of #today-daily) and habits
  (`#today-daily`, one card per Habits project, kept together as ONE
  section). `applyTodayOrder()` (end of renderToday, and on a move) puts
  them in `todayOrder()` order (settings.todayOrder, default tasks/
  calendar/habits) before #today-none, only touching the DOM when it
  differs. Menu > Today > Edit layout (`#p-todaylayout`,
  `renderTodayLayout`, `A.moveTodaySection`) — the up/down list is the
  shared `orderCard(list,fn)`, also used by Statistics' Edit layout. When
  a ticked habit (vanish mode) or calendar task leaves Today,
  `_dropEmptyCard(sec)` removes an emptied card WITH its title and re-runs
  syncTodaySections (before, the title stayed, and the last habit left a
  "Nothing scheduled for today." line). Anything new that reads Today's
  calendar rows must look in #today-cal, not #today-daily.
- Today's section headers (🎯 Tasks / 📆 Habits) are hidden when their
  section is empty (`syncTodaySections`), with one "Nothing to do today."
  line if both are. "Category with no tasks" in the user's wording meant
  THESE sections on Today, not the Daily page's per-weekday categories —
  I misread it once and changed Daily instead (reverted); when a request
  names a page ("in daily" was mistranscribed voice input), confirm which
  screen from the words around it before editing. Also: a swipe-skip must
  be saved (`DB.skipTask`) at the START of the gesture, not after the
  slide animation — leaving Today mid-animation re-rendered from
  unsaved data and the task "reappeared".

- "Refill automatically" OFF on Today means the day gets N task slots
  (`DB.data.todaySet = {ds,n,keys}`), filled once; a task that's completed
  or skipped keeps its slot used, so nothing replaces it — not even after
  leaving Today and coming back (renderToday re-runs on every visit and
  used to re-pick the top N each time, which looked like "the skipped/done
  task came back" — it was a NEW task filling the gap; it took a
  screenshot from the user's phone and their plain-words description to
  see that, after I'd chased a persistence bug that didn't exist). Refill
  ON clears the set and always shows the top N. The set resets on a new
  day or when the Tasks-shown count changes. With Refill ON (3.44), a done or
  skipped task is swapped IN PLACE (`todayRefillSwap`): its row shrinks
  while the next task's row (always at the bottom — priority order) grows,
  same duration, so the card keeps its height and nothing below it moves;
  then `renderToday` normalizes. It used to collapse first and then push
  back down ("everything below moves up and then down again"). Task picking
  and row markup live in `todayTopTasks()` / `todayTaskRow()`. When a "reappears" report
  can't be reproduced, first ask what the reappearing thing actually IS
  (same item vs a different one) before instrumenting anything.

- Keep failed-attempt history in this file, not in code comments: the
  sheet scroll-lock / overlay code had accumulated paragraphs about
  approaches that no longer existed (and a stale "safety reset" comment
  for code that was gone). Comments in index.html should describe what
  the code does now and why; the story of how we got there belongs here.
  When a fix is superseded, delete the old code AND its comment in the
  same change, and don't leave "Temporary:" entries in CHANGELOG (keep the
  version entry, reword it — WhatsNew's queue looks versions up by name).

- Trash (Settings > Trash, page id `p-archive`, `renderArchive`/`Trash`):
  nothing is deleted outright anymore. Every delete path snapshots into
  `DB.data.trash` (`{id,type,label,sub,at,data}`, types: habit, project,
  entry — a deleted category is NOT an entry: its projects/habits are
  trashed one by one, each carrying a snapshot of the category so
  restoring recreates it; old category/habitcat entries are split on load) and `DB.restoreTrash(id)` puts it back
  (recreating a missing parent category from the snapshot; an entry needs
  its project to exist, else it returns a message).
  A project can also be deleted from its own edit window (3.30:
  `SheetEditor.remove`, a red "Delete project" row shown only when editing
  an existing project that isn't the Daily one) — same `DB.deleteProject`
  as Edit layout. The confirm (a centred Alert since 3.67) opens after the
  edit sheet has closed; if you're on that project's page, it navigates
  back first and rebuilds the pages after the slide. Completed tasks are
  still `DB.data.archived` and are the first tab (labelled Tasks). A NEW delete path must
  push to trash too (use `DB._trash`, and `_takeProject`/`_putProject`
  for projects) — grep `filter(` on dailyItems/dailyCats/projects when
  adding one. Settings > Overview > "Reset a project" (`DB.resetProject`) empties one
  project into the Trash: To-do/List tasks become `archived` entries with
  `removed:true` (no `dateISO`, so they don't count as completed in the
  stats), tracker entries become `entry` trash items, Daily's habits become
  `habit` items and its categories are removed. Ticking a one-time task (`dailyOnce`) archives it
  (`section:'One-time', once:true, due`) into Trash > Tasks (2.58); `restoreTask` puts a
  `once` entry back on the calendar with its old date.
  3.98: `DB.completeTask` (ticking a task off) now stores the task's `pri`
  and `desc` on the archived entry — it only kept key/text/section, and
  `restoreTask` falls back to `pri||'bs'`, so every restored task came back
  as High (a War Room task lost War Room) without its notes. resetProject
  already stored both. Entries archived before 3.98 have no pri and still
  restore as High — nothing to recover them from.

- Language (Settings > Language, `I18N` in index.html): English is the
  source text in markup and JS; German is a DOM translation layer — `DE`
  maps exact English strings to German, `RULES` (regex) handles strings
  with numbers, a TreeWalker + MutationObserver translate text nodes and
  placeholder/title attributes (original kept on the node so switching
  back restores it). So: NEW UI TEXT needs an entry in `I18N`'s `DE`
  (or a rule if it has a number/name in it) or it stays English in
  German mode; `Alert` runs its text through `t()` itself (it splits the
  TRANSLATED text into title/message, so pass English); other strings that
  never reach the DOM must go through `t()`; CSS `content:` strings need an `html[lang="de"]`
  override. Text built as one string from a label + user content
  ("Tracking: "+name) needs a rule, not a DE entry. A DE key that is an
  ordinary word can also translate a user's own item with that exact
  name — acceptable, but avoid adding very generic keys. Dates already
  used de-CH everywhere, so they were left alone; What's new notes stay
  English. To find gaps, switch to German and walk every page/sheet
  listing text nodes that lack `__en`.

- NAMING (3.57): the Settings tab/page is called "Menu" on screen (tab
  label, page title, "Open app on" option, Guide tips and data notices say
  "Menu → Today" / "Menu > Data"; German "Menü"). Code names are unchanged —
  page `p-settings`, tab id 'settings', `renderSettings`, SETTINGS_SUBPAGES,
  `DB.data.settings` — and these notes still say "Settings > X" for its
  pages. New user-facing text must say Menu. "Reset settings" keeps its
  name (it resets settings). Overlap to know about: General has its own
  "Menu" section (which tabs show in the tab bar) — so Menu > General > Menu.
- Habit categories are hidden "for now" (3.76): Daily's day panels and
  Today show all habits in ONE card titled with the Habits project's name
  (`habitsTitle(pid)`), in the universal dailyItems order; the + menu has no
  "Manage categories" (DailyCatSheet and its markup were deleted — see git
  history before 3.76 to bring it back), adding a habit / tracking a project
  has no category step, the habit page subtitle is just the days. The data
  stays: dailyCats and each habit's catId are kept, and new habits go into
  the first category (`DB.habitCatId()`, which creates one named after the
  project if there's none) because Trash restores rely on a habit's
  category. Renaming the Habits project redraws the cards (SheetEditor.save).
- Sound and Notifications live in Menu > General (3.63; a separate Menu
  card in 3.61 and their own pages in 3.62 were both dropped by request):
  "Sounds" (3.65; was "Tick-off sound") is a switch in the Hold-to-complete card
  (`settings.sound`, default on; off makes `playClick()` — the click when a
  hold completes something, the app's only sound — return early), and a
  "Notifications" section at the bottom is a card saying "Coming soon"
  (`.cal-none`, static, not tappable). Notifications would need a push
  server (web apps can't schedule local notifications on iOS); not built.
- Settings is a LIST of widgets that each open their own full page (no
  sheets): App (version, "Update automatically" switch = `settings.autoUpdate`,
  manual "Check for updates", version history), Appearance (theme), General
  (Open app on + Menu), then Today / Overview / Statistics / Data, plus
  Hold-to-complete / Language / Trash on the main list. Sub-pages are plain
  `.page.sp` elements listed in `SETTINGS_SUBPAGES` (back returns to
  Settings, the Settings tab stays lit; Menu's back goes to General);
  `renderSettings()` fills all their containers, so a new setting only needs
  its markup in the right container. Menu > Tasks (`#settings-tasks`, was
  an empty page until 4.8) has "Open on" (`settings.tasksView`: tasks /
  list / calendar, default tasks, read via `LockedIn.startView()`):
  `LockedIn.view` is set from it at launch, on Reset settings and when it
  changes; the header view button still switches for the rest of the
  session. Grey icon squares are ONE grey,
  #6b7280 (4.7, "tasks in settings should have the same grey as the
  others": Tasks was #8e8e93, Data/Trash #71717a, General/System #6b7280).
  Sub-pages have NO icons on their rows (only the main list does) — except Appearance, whose Light/Dark/System rows keep theirs by request, and the Guide list (Hidden features = white-filled masquerade mask, eyes cut out, centered on 12/12, on #6366f1, the Dark theme icon's violet, 3.52 — was purple sparkles in 3.51; give new Guide rows an icon too). The `.sp` class carries the slim
  no-outline settings styling (it used to be `#p-settings`). The old Version
  history / Menu bottom sheets were removed.
  Guide (3.43): the very top of Settings is its own one-row card, "Guide"
  (`#settings-guide`, orange book icon — asked for with "a fitting emoji",
  done as an icon like the other rows), opening `#p-guide`. Since 3.50
  `#p-guide` is a list of rows like Settings (with icons since 3.51), each
  opening its own page of tips; first row "Hidden features"
  (`#p-guide-hidden`: skip by swiping right, move projects by holding, move
  habits by holding). A tip is a `.guide-item` (`.guide-t` title +
  `.guide-p` paragraph) in the page's one white card; new tips go into the
  fitting page (+ a DE entry). A new Guide page: add it to
  SETTINGS_SUBPAGES (tab lighting) and to `_backTarget`'s no-history
  fallback (-> 'guide'), like `guide-hidden`. Auto update = a silent
  `A.checkForUpdate(true)` at launch and on resume after 30 min; it only
  speaks up (progress overlay, then reload) when an update exists.

- Update detection (2.28): the service-worker events (`updatefound`,
  `controllerchange`) are not trustworthy on iOS, and worse, the page's own
  `fetch('sw.js')` used to be answered from the SW's cache-first handler
  with a STALE stored copy — so "compare with the server" was comparing the
  device with itself. sw.js now returns early for its own URL (never cached
  or intercepted), and `A._latestInstalled()` fetches `sw.js?c=<now>`,
  reads `CACHE_NAME` and checks `caches.keys()` for it: a missing cache
  means a newer release exists regardless of what the events said. If the
  normal flow reports "no update" but that check says outdated,
  `A._hardUpdate()` unregisters the worker, deletes the caches and
  `location.replace`s to `?v=<now>` (localStorage untouched). Auto updates
  (`settings.autoUpdate`) run `checkForUpdate(true)` 1.2s after launch and
  on resume after 5 min. Every release must still bump CACHE_NAME (that's what the
  comparison keys on).

- Tracker charts (3.89, `trackerChart(pid,p,entries,goal)`, drawn by
  renderTracker; asked for with a CoinMarketCap screenshot): ONE line style
  — 3px, round, `TRK_GREEN` #30d158 (the Statistics ring green), a dot on
  every entry (3.91: small, r 2.25, dark grey #3a3a3c / #aeaeb2 in dark
  mode — "dark grey and a bit smaller"; they were green/red by value). Moving average on = the line IS the 7-entry average and the
  dots stay unconnected (it used to be a thin faint raw line + a thick amber
  average). The average window is fixed at 7 (the Window size field is
  gone; `maWindow` is deleted on the next save and ignored). Goal = the
  linked Daily habit's `goal` (only trackers added as a habit have one):
  dotted grey goal line, the y range always includes it; line + fade are
  drawn twice, clipped above/below the goal (clipPath ids per pid, since
  every project page is in the DOM) — green above, red (#ff3b30 / #ff453a
  dark) below, the fade is a gradient from the chart edge to the goal;
  bars are coloured by their own value, reaching the goal = green (same as
  habitDayVal). Bar chart (`p.chartBars`, a switch in the edit window's
  "Chart" section): one bar per ENTRY (the values, not done/not done),
  evenly spaced, starting a little below the lowest value (lowest of
  entries/goal minus a quarter of the spread, floored to a round step, never
  below 0 for positive data — 3.91; from 0, "1 or 2 kg won't be a visible
  difference"), only the latest entries that fit at ≥ ~2.4px
  (CW/4); rounded tops. The Moving average row is hidden while Bar chart is
  on (it's line-only). The big number has its unit next to it (`.trk-u`).
- Two update logs (3.83, "no one is reading it — it's way too complicated"):
  Menu > App has a switch "Advanced update info" (`settings.advancedUpdates`,
  default OFF; 3.83 as its own card, since 3.84 the App page is ONE card in
  the order asked for: Version, Advanced update info, Update automatically,
  Check for updates). On = the detailed `CHANGELOG`
  as before (for the user as tester/dev). Off = `USER_LOG` (right after
  CHANGELOG), for everyone else: a version is either a real new feature,
  as an array of lines, or 'bug' / 'design' / 'both'. Feature lines are
  SUPER short (3.85, the user's own examples: "Update notes are shorter",
  "Skipping habits now possible in the project itself", "Multiple habit
  projects possible"): a few words, no details, no "Menu → X" paths, no
  full stop, usually one line per version. 3.83's first try (a casual
  sentence or two with where to find it) was still too long. Versions not listed are guessed by
  `userLogKind` (a note starting "Fixed" = bug, anything else = design) —
  the whole history up to 3.83 was backfilled by hand for features (48
  entries, a few kind overrides). `simpleHistory()` merges each run of
  fix-only versions into one entry ("Beta 3.78 – 3.80" · Design fixes,
  grey `.wn-fix`), 281 → 79 entries. What's New in simple mode shows only
  the pending versions' feature lines, and an update with nothing but
  fixes doesn't pop up at all (just marked seen) — my call, so the pop-up
  means "something new to use"; easy to undo in `WhatsNew.open`. Flipping
  the switch redraws only the history (`renderAppHistory`), not the card.
  What counts as a feature: something the user can newly DO or see (a new
  setting, gesture, page, tab); renames, restyles, moves and spacing are
  design; anything that was broken is bug. A big visible change can still
  get a line (2.55 redesign, 3.76 categories gone).
- Centred pop-ups (3.67, `Alert`, `#alert-overlay`), asked for with an
  iOS screenshot: short confirmations and messages appear in the middle of
  the screen instead of a slide-up. `Alert.confirm(text, fn, label)` (Cancel
  blue + red action, default "Delete") replaced ConfirmSheet everywhere (the
  sheet and its markup are gone); `Alert.info(text)` (one OK) replaced the
  browser's own alert()/confirm() — Edit layout's delete category/project,
  update-check results, Trash "Restore the project first.", Daily's "No
  tracker projects yet" — which iOS titled with the web address. Text is
  split into bold title + smaller message after the first "? ", else at
  " — ", else after the first sentence (title's final "." dropped). Unlike
  sheets, it HAS Cancel/OK and a tap outside does nothing (iOS alerts work
  that way); swipe-back is ignored while it's open (`Alert._open`). Opens
  via `_overlayOpen` (scroll lock, touchmove block, two-frame open): fade +
  scale 1.1→1; closes with a fade only. Colours: `--blue`, new `--red`
  (#ff3b30 / #ff453a dark). Not converted (by choice, "C" in the proposal):
  one-field inputs (new/rename category, rename habit, tracker values) —
  a centred box with a field needs its own keyboard handling. Longer windows
  stay sheets.
- Export / Import — CURRENT (4.0): `DataCodec.pack` writes "LOS3:" + plain
  base64 of the deflated `_prep(json)`: `_shortIds` (every id → prefix +
  counter; only habits ('di') keep their 13-digit time), `_noPhotos` (ALL
  data:image strings dropped, Trash too — "leave the photos out for now";
  projects fall back to their emoji), settings equal to DEFAULT_SETTINGS
  dropped (DB._migrate refills them), `_packChecks`, `_enc`. The Export
  window shows the length and a per-part breakdown (`DataCodec.sizes`) —
  that's how to see what takes the room on the user's real data. Measured:
  light user (3 projects, 12 tasks, 5 habits × 30 days, 30 entries, 20
  done) 10,117 → 1,249 chars; heavy half year 125,120 → 3,545 (one 160px
  JPEG photo alone was 7,911). What's left is real content, mostly the
  words of tasks and done tasks; "a few hundred" would mean leaving history
  out (done tasks, habit history, tracker entries, Trash) — offered, not
  built. 3.97–3.99 used CJK characters (LOS2): 2.3x fewer characters but
  10k CJK glyphs made the window lag on the iPhone and the user wanted
  "normal signs" — `_fromCjk` stays only to read those old exports. Copy/
  Share buttons are `.native-tap` (TAPPABLE bails out → the browser's own
  click, the surest user activation for clipboard/share on iOS).
  History of the format, 3.96–3.99: `DataCodec.pack` wrote "LOS2:" + CJK text. Pipeline (see the
  comment on DataCodec): shorten ids (`_shortIds`: prefix + 13-digit time
  kept, random tail → a counter, mapped identically in every key/value —
  random text is incompressible, ~25%), `_packChecks` (dailyChecks → day
  gaps + one mark row per habit), `_enc` (lists of 3+ same-shaped objects →
  columns, whole-number columns → deltas), deflate, then `_toCjk`: 14 bits
  per character from U+4E00 (2.3x fewer chars than base64; ~28% MORE bytes
  in UTF-8 — the user counts visible text, and the bytes never matter
  here). Half-year test set: plain 111,851 → LOS1 11,425 → LOS2 2,005
  chars; round trip identical (canonical compare after the same id
  mapping), incl. false/'skip'/odd check values, line breaks and extra
  words around the pasted text (`_fromCjk` skips anything off-alphabet).
  `unpack` still reads "LOS1:" (3.96, base64 deflate) and plain JSON. Ids
  change on import by design; habitCreatedDs still works (time kept). A new
  id prefix must be added to `_shortIds`' regex or its ids just stay long.
  3.99, "export and paste into Telegram, nothing happens": 3.96–3.98 copied
  from the Export tap itself via ClipboardItem with a PROMISE (to stay in
  the tap while compressing) — on the iPhone the clipboard ended up empty
  (can't be tested here). Now Export opens `ExportSheet`: the text is
  compressed first and shown (selectable: `.exp-text` re-enables
  user-select/touch-callout, which `*` turns off app-wide), then Copy does
  a plain writeText of READY text inside its own tap (fallback: select +
  execCommand('copy'), else "Tap and hold the text to copy it"), and Share
  = navigator.share({text}) → iOS share sheet (Telegram etc.; hidden where
  there's no share). Don't go back to copying async-made text from the
  opening tap. Preview can't exercise the clipboard/share: synthetic
  touches give no activation, and `.opt-row` rows open on the native click
  (TAPPABLE skips them), so use el.click() to open things in tests. With
  many project photos the export gets long (photos barely compress) and
  may exceed a chat message (Telegram: 4096 characters). Export hands the
  clipboard a ClipboardItem whose value is a PROMISE (Safari only allows
  clipboard writes inside the tap, and compressing is async), falls back
  to writeText, then to the copy-by-hand InputSheet; success shows "Data
  copied" (it was silent). Import shows an Alert on text it can't read (it
  silently ignored it). No device without CompressionStream is known in
  use; such a device exports plain JSON. The app has no hardcoded address
  (manifest/sw use relative paths), so the same data moves to a new
  address via Export → Import inside the NEW home-screen icon (each icon
  has its own storage).
- Import (4.4, after "That isn't data from this app" on a direct copy from
  the old icon into the new one — cause not visible from here, so both
  suspects fixed and the message made diagnostic): (1) importData used to
  save to localStorage and THEN redraw in place; a redraw error landed in
  the same catch and said the data was unreadable although it was saved.
  Now: unpack → JSON.parse → setItem → DB.load → location.reload(); the
  catch says which STEP failed (read/check/save), the error message, how
  many export characters arrived (compare with Export's count), or — no
  LOS tag — how many characters were pasted and how they start. (2) Text
  around the export no longer breaks it: `_fromB64` ends the base64 at its
  '=' padding / a whole 4-char group, `_unzip` reads the stream in pieces
  and keeps everything decompressed before a trailing-junk error. Cut-off
  exports still fail (half a JSON), with that message. `_packChecks` keeps
  non-YYYY-MM-DD keys raw in `w` (an old 'NaN-NaN-NaN' key used to be
  merged into the previous day — null gap = 0).
  Also 4.4: checkForUpdate never hard-updates while the page isn't
  controlled yet or a worker is installing/waiting — on a FIRST launch
  (new icon = empty storage) the 1.2s auto-check found no cache for the
  newest version, called _hardUpdate (unregister + delete caches +
  reload) and on a slow connection could loop. Found because the preview
  kept navigating after my SW/cache cleanup. Preview note: unregister()
  then register() in the same tab resurrects the OLD registration (no
  install, no cache) — not what a real first launch does.
- 4.5, the real import failure (found only via 4.4's diagnostic message,
  which showed the pasted start): the export arrived as "los3:eF61…" — the
  LABEL lowercased somewhere between the old app's Copy and the new app's
  paste (body intact; cause on the phone unknown), and unpack looked for
  exactly "LOS3:". `DataCodec.findTag` now matches /los([123])\s*:/i, and
  a text with no label at all is still decoded when it starts like zlib
  base64 ("eA"/"eF"/"eJ"/"eN"). Also learned: the iPhone's
  CompressionStream writes zlib header 78 5E ("eF…"), Chrome 78 9C
  ("eJ…") — both decode everywhere; test iPhone-style data by
  re-compressing with Python `zlib.compress(raw, 2)`. Verified with the
  REAL 4.2 export code (extracted from git) in every variant. Lesson: when
  a user-side failure can't be reproduced, ship a message that SHOWS the
  input (length + first characters) — one screenshot ended three rounds of
  guessing.
- A window's Save must never run twice (3.95, a friend on Android got TWO
  projects from one creation): SheetEditor.save kept `newCatId` and no
  `pid` after saving, and the sheet stays tappable while it slides away
  (SHEET_ANIM_MS), so a double tap / a tap during the slide / Enter + tap
  created a duplicate — same for new task, habit, calendar item, tracker
  entry and category. Every creating save/confirm now starts with
  `if(!_sheetLive('<overlay id>'))return;` — live = `.on` and not
  `ov._closing` (set at the start of _overlayClose, cleared in
  _overlayOpen). Not keyed on `.show` (added two rAFs after opening): a
  Save must never depend on a frame having painted. (A first test looked
  like `.show` was late — it wasn't: the fresh preview data had no
  category, so "new project" opened the category window instead. Seed a
  category before testing project creation.) A NEW sheet that creates
  something needs the same first line.
- Bottom sheets have NO Cancel/Close/back buttons (only real actions like
  Save/OK/Delete/Got it): they close by pulling down or tapping the dimmed
  background, and every `.sheet` gets a grey `.sheet-drag-handle` injected
  at load so that's obvious. The generic pull-down (search "Every bottom
  sheet closes by pulling it down") only takes over when the sheet is at its
  scroll top, follows the finger, and on release runs the overlay's own
  onclick (so a pull behaves exactly like a background tap, including
  cancel callbacks) with `_instantClose=true` so `_overlayClose` doesn't wait
  a second animation. A new sheet only needs `.sheet-overlay` with an onclick
  close and a `.sheet` child — no close button, and don't add one.

- Design system (2.55, the "DESIGN SYSTEM" block at the end of the CSS): the
  Settings look is the look of the whole app. (`--press`, the pressed-row
  color, is darker than the card in light mode but LIGHTER in dark mode —
  #3a3836 on the #1e1c1a card since 3.22; it was a darker #0d1219.)
  Cards are `var(--card)` on
  `var(--pg)`, radius 14, NO outlines, 1.5px `var(--line)` dividers, rows 46px.
  Ink (3.64, "all the almost black text full black, almost white full
  white"): `--ink` and every text/icon/ink-border/ink-fill colour is pure
  #000 in light mode and #fff in dark (was #1a1917 / #e8e6df — replaced
  everywhere, incl. %23-encoded SVGs). Surfaces, greys and tints (#f3f4f6,
  dark cards, --pg, the green/red tints) were left alone. New code: use
  var(--ink) (or #000/#fff), never an off-black/off-white.
  3.82 regression from that replace ("full black doesn't work"): it also
  turned the Black PROJECT colour (`COLORS['c-black']`, was '#1a1917') into
  the 3-digit '#000'. Project colours get alpha APPENDED as hex
  (`tintStyle`: col+'20' / '2e' / 'd9', the photo preview, the project
  header) and parsed by slices (`solidTintStyle`, `paleFillColor`), so
  '#000'+'20' = '#00020' was invalid CSS: Black projects lost their badge
  and tile background (the minimal tile got rgb(NaN…)) for 18 versions.
  Now '#000000'. Every value in COLORS must stay 6-digit hex, and a global
  colour replace must skip COLORS. Also since 3.82 `themeCol(col)` makes
  Black the ink colour — white in dark mode (black text on a dark card was
  unreadable, before 3.64 too); tintStyle/solidTintStyle and the two inline
  places in SheetEditor call it. The colour picker's swatch stays black.
  Card spacing on pages (3.49, "the same extra amount with and without a
  title"): 20px between two cards, 22px from a card down to a section title
  (title to its own card stays 8px) — the old 14 / 16 + 6. It's set on the
  CARDS (margin-bottom 22px, and -2px margin-top on a card right after a
  card, also when each card is wrapped in its own container, via `:has`),
  NOT by raising the titles' margin-top: a title's top margin collapses
  with the header's 20px, so the first title of a page (Today with or
  without tasks, Tasks, Statistics, Daily's first category, Overview
  without a War Room) moved down with it. Rule is scoped to `.page`, so
  sheets keep their own spacing. Verified by measuring every page's gaps
  with the rule deleted from the CSSOM vs present: every difference was
  exactly +6 and no header gap changed. Version history's title keeps its
  own inline margin (32px, was 26).
  Text roles (weights lightened in 2.56 — the "lighter weights" rule at the end of the
  block wins): page title 20/700 (26/700 on pushed pages via `.hh`), row text
  15/500, secondary 12/500 grey, paragraph 13/500 grey, uppercase label
  (`.sl`/`.shdr`/`.caltitle`/`.el-grp`/`.sheet-label`) 11/700 in `--label`
  grey (#a3a3a3 light since 3.40, was #bbb; #bbb dark), buttons 15/500,
  badges/pills 12/500. Groups of rows live in ONE card (`.card-list` for task
  rows, `.opt-group`, `.el-card`, `.calsec`), not one card per row. Header
  buttons are soft 40px squares (`.hh-btn`, and `.hdr-add/.menu-btn/.back/
  .edit-proj-btn` are restyled to match); pushed pages (project pages, Edit
  layout, Daily, habit detail, Settings sub-pages) all use the `.hh` header.
  PRESS of those small square buttons (4.12, `SQ_BTNS`: .hdr-add .menu-btn
  .back .edit-proj-btn .addbtn .hh-btn .el-btn): NO grey — "the grey color
  change is only for the bar buttons". They scale to .86 (.12s) and spring
  back with overshoot (.35s cubic-bezier(.34,1.56,.64,1)) — option A of a
  tappable demo; the user didn't pick, then asked again angrily after I
  shipped other things first, so I picked A. When a request needs the
  user's pick and they move on without one, pick a sensible option and
  ship it rather than leave it waiting. `.sq-press` is added on touchstart
  and held ≥ SQ_PRESS_MIN (110ms) so quick taps show it; `:active` covers
  the mouse. The old opacity:.7 :active rules were deleted. DSel.show now
  measures its anchor's RESTING box (centre of the rect ± offsetWidth/
  Height/2), since a pressed button is scaled when its dropdown opens.
  Don't add these buttons back to the "Press grey timing" lists.
  Sheets have a grey (`--pg`) background with white inputs/rows; their buttons
  (`.sheet-save`, `.danger` for red) are white rows with blue text like
  Settings' buttons, choice lists (`#cat-choices`, `#add-choice-list`,
  `#cat-btn-list`) are one white card with dividers, option buttons are
  `.type-btn` in a `.type-grid`. The new block uses `html:not(#x)` to beat the
  older theme-specific rules above it — when restyling something, put the
  change in that block rather than editing the old rules again. New inputs
  inside an `.opt-row` need the `input` bail-out in the TAPPABLE handler
  (already added). No emojis on categories, section titles, choice rows or
  type buttons (only user-chosen project icons remain).
  Icon line weight (3.45, picked "A · Refined" from a side-by-side
  comparison): outline icons use stroke-width 1.7 where they were 2.2 (tab
  bar, +, lock, type icons) and 1.8 where they were 2 (Settings icons,
  back/header buttons, chevrons…); the bolder ones shrank by the same step
  (Skip arrow 2.1). Chart strokes (1, 3, 10) and the tick/skip glyphs inside
  tick boxes (data-URI SVGs) are separate and unchanged. New icons should
  use 1.8 (1.7 at 24px in the tab bar).
  The tick/skip glyph inside a 26px tick box is drawn at 18px (3.46; was
  17px): (26-17)/2 = 4.5px put it on a half pixel, which the phone smooths
  (soft edges); an even difference keeps it on whole pixels. For
  consistency with the refined icons (3.46) the tick is stroke 2.6 (was
  3.2), the skip arrow 2.5 (was 3) and the War Room box outline 1.5px (was
  2px).
  Same half-pixel trap, found twice more in 3.53 from a zoomed phone
  screenshot: (1) Settings-page icons were 19px in the 30px `.opt-ico`
  square -> 5.5px margins, and iOS drew every icon a touch right and low;
  now 20px (`.sp .opt-ico svg`, 5px each side). Also an icon's drawing must
  be centred on 12,12 of its viewBox — the Today icon (tab bar, reused in
  Settings) was 0.75 low and `trashSvg` 0.5 low; both moved up. Check with
  getBBox() centre, not by eye. (2) The War Room box outline was an inset
  box-shadow of 1.5px = 4.5 device px on a 3x iPhone; WebKit rounds the
  shadow's inner edge the same direction on every side, so left/top drew
  5 px thick and right/bottom 4. Now a `border` (box-sizing:border-box),
  whose width WebKit floors to whole device pixels on all four sides
  (3.59: 1.67px, asked for "a tiny bit thicker" — exactly 5 device px on a
  3x iPhone, where 1.5px floored to 4 and looked thinner than the 1.5px =
  4.5 px icon strokes; 2x screens still get 3 px = 1.5px; not 1.6667, whose
  x3 can fall just under 5 and floor to 4). Don't
  draw thin outlines with fractional inset shadows; this preview is 2x
  (1.5px = 3 device px exactly), so it never shows the 3x asymmetry.
  3.55 follow-up, "still inconsistent for some squares": every Today row's
  `.sw-row` had a permanent `will-change:transform` — its own compositing
  layer, starting at a fractional pixel y that differs per row (row heights
  include fractional text line heights), so a thin line inside was smoothed
  differently row to row. Now only `.sw.on .sw-row` (the swipe adds `.on`
  when it really starts, `close()` removes it). Keep will-change off
  anything that sits still. Unverifiable here (2x preview); if it persists,
  get a zoomed phone screenshot saying WHICH squares/screen before guessing.
  3.56, "the lower stripe feels thinner on some boxes" — the real cause:
  rows were `height:48px` border-box WITH their 0.5px divider inside, so the
  centred box sat 10.75px down (10.83 on a 3x phone = half a device pixel)
  in every row except the last (no divider), and its edges were smoothed
  across two pixels. Rows (`.ti/.cali/.wri`, `.sp`/`.sheet .opt-row`) are
  now content-box: the divider is added below the 48/46px, box offset is
  exactly 11px (Settings icons 8px) in every row. `.cali.split>label`
  line-height 48px to match. DragReorder sets `boxSizing:border-box` inline
  on a picked-up row (its inline width/height are the outer size) and clears
  it on drop. Text stacked above cards got whole-pixel line heights too
  (`.dtitle` 24, `.hh-title` 30, section titles 14, `.wrt` 18, `.wrd` 16,
  `.dname` 12, `.dnum` 19) so cards start on whole pixels. RULE: anything
  with thin edges (boxes, outlines, icons) must land on a whole pixel —
  give new stacked text an integer px line-height, keep dividers outside
  fixed row heights, and check with getBoundingClientRect: in this 2x
  preview every box top should be a multiple of .5 and its offset in the
  row a whole number.
  Before chasing a "this line is thicker/darker than that one" report from
  a screenshot, check the screenshot's SCALE first: rows are 48px + a
  divider floored to 1 device px = 145 device px apart on the 3x iPhone.
  3.86 report ("the 2 middle stripes are a nuthair thicker or darker"): the
  images came through with rows 132 px apart (~91%, scaled somewhere
  between the phone and here), so every 1-px divider was resampled at a
  different sub-pixel phase — measured with PIL: each line held the same
  total grey (39–43) but split 223/247 on some and 238/229 on others.
  Layout in the app was identical for every row (same element, height,
  border, no layers). Nothing was changed; if it's reported on the LIVE
  screen, ask which screen and whether Display Zoom is on.
  Count badges: none left. The Trash count in Settings (`.ab`/`#ab2`), the
  War Room count on Overview (`.wrb`) and Tasks' per-priority counts
  (`.sl-count`) were unified in 3.17/3.18, then all removed (3.21, 3.29) as
  unnecessary — don't bring them back unasked.
  Skip swipe area (`.sw-act`, 3.42): square on the LEFT (flush with the
  row; the card's own clip rounds it on first/last rows), rounded 12px only
  on the right, toward the sliding row — it was rounded all round, leaving
  white corners on the left.
  Skip icon: ONE arrow (3.29; it was a double arrow) — in a skipped tick
  box (`.cali.skipped` checkbox background) and the swipe action
  (`SKIP_ICON`).
  A ticked TASK box (`.ti`/`.wri` :checked) is the same `--go` green with a
  white tick as a done habit (3.48; it was the ink/black box) — you only see
  it for the moment before the row fades out to the Trash, so "done" looks
  the same everywhere. (`--tick-ink` is now unused by tick boxes.)
  War Room marker (3.31, picked from five mockups): a red TICK BOX (inset
  2px `--war` outline, `--war-bg` fill; unticked only) on `.ti[data-pri=
  "bu"]` and every `.wri`. The red stripe it replaced (inset box-shadow on
  the row) followed each row's radius: one long curved line in Tasks, a
  separate curved stripe per row in Today (each row is its own `.sw`), so
  it could never look the same everywhere. Don't mark rows by their edges.

- `.cali`'s press-grey went through two rounds (2.87, then 2.88 — the
  2.87 approach is superseded, don't resurrect it). First round tried to
  keep `.cali`'s box model as-is (edge inset via a `.calsec>.cali{margin:
  0 -15.5px;padding:0 10px}` hack) and patch around `swipeWrap('h',...)`
  wrapping habit rows in `.sw.h > .sw-row > .cali` when Settings > Today
  > "Skip habits" is ON: scoped the CSS rule to `.calsec>.cali` (direct
  child only) and added a separate `.pressed-row` class on `.sw-row` for
  the wrapped case. That fixed the two reported symptoms (checkbox press
  greying the row; grey not reaching the edges) but still left `.cali`
  laid out differently from Settings' `.opt-row`, and got flagged
  immediately as still visibly misaligned ("the top is not aligning") —
  told directly to stop patching and copy `.opt-row`'s actual layout
  instead of reverse-engineering another fix. `.opt-row` never needs any
  inset hack in the first place because `.opt-group` (its card) carries
  NO padding of its own — `.opt-row` supplies its own `padding:0 14px`
  directly and that alone reaches the card's true edge. `.cali`/`.calsec`
  had the opposite arrangement (card padded, row unpadded, then a
  negative-margin hack to fix it back up) for no real reason. Fixed by
  making `.calsec` match `.opt-group`: `#today-daily .calsec,[id^="dp-"]
  .calsec` padding is now `0` (2.88 still kept a 2px top padding "for the
  gap under the category title" — but the title sits OUTSIDE the card, so
  those 2px were white inside the card above the first row, reported in
  2.89 as "a white strip at the top that isn't grey"; removed), `.cali`
  itself carries `padding:0 14px` directly, and the old `.calsec>.cali`
  margin hack plus
  the `.sw.h`/`.sw-row` margin/padding/`.sw-act` offset overrides are all
  gone outright — with the card unpadded, `.sw.h` is naturally already
  flush, so none of that compensation is needed whether a row is wrapped
  or not. This also means `.cali` is now uniformly the correctly-sized,
  full-bleed element in EVERY case (Today or Daily, Skip habits on or
  off), so the wrapped-vs-unwrapped CSS split from the 2.87 round is
  gone too: one rule, `.cali:not(.locked).pressed-row`, covers all of
  it. The checkbox-exclusion problem itself was real and stays fixed the
  same way regardless of layout — `.cali`'s checkbox is a normal,
  visibly-sized input and genuinely IS the touch target (unlike
  `.switch input`, deliberately `width:0;height:0` so it's never what
  the finger actually lands on), and `:has(input:active)` could not be
  confirmed reliable for excluding a real touch target on-device (only
  testable here via synthetic DOM events, not real `:active` state). The
  `.pressed-row` class is still JS-driven (search "Press feedback for
  habit rows"): a touchstart/touchmove/touchend IIFE that bails out on
  `closest('input')` — the same style of bail-out TAPPABLE already uses
  — and clears on >10px movement so a swipe starting doesn't leave the
  grey stuck. Verified via dispatched TouchEvents (checkbox press never
  adds the class; bar press does and now measures exactly equal to
  `.calsec`'s width in both Today and Daily) plus a visual screenshot.
  Lesson worth keeping: when two structurally-identical widgets
  (`.opt-row`/`.opt-group` vs `.cali`/`.calsec`) end up laid out
  differently for no functional reason, matching the ALREADY-WORKING
  one's actual box model is more reliable than layering CSS specificity
  tricks on top of the divergent one — asked for explicitly here after
  the narrower patch still visibly didn't match. `.sw.t` (tasks) uses
  the same `swipeWrap`/`.sw-row` structure and hasn't been reported
  broken or misaligned, so it was deliberately left as-is; if it ever
  is, this same box-model mismatch is the first thing to check.
  Removing `.calsec`'s horizontal padding in 2.88 also silently left the
  "No habits" placeholder (`.cal-none`, the only non-row child of a
  Daily card) flush against the card's left edge — it had relied on the
  card's padding. Fixed in 2.89 (`.cal-none` carries its own 14px). When
  moving padding from a container onto its rows, check every OTHER kind
  of child that container can hold, not just the rows.
  2.89 — habit rows (`ci()`/`ciEdit()`, class `cali split`) are two
  buttons that between them cover every point of the row, asked for
  explicitly ("one for the tick off where it doesn't get grey and the
  rest of the bar where it does"): `.cali-tick` (a span around the
  checkbox, padding `0 12px 0 14px`, full row height) — a tap anywhere
  in it ticks via `tickZone()` (forwards to `cb.click()` unless the tap
  landed on the checkbox itself, which toggles natively, and does
  nothing in hold-to-complete mode) and never greys; and the label,
  stretched to full height (`align-self:stretch;line-height:47px`,
  line-height rather than flex-centering so its ellipsis keeps working)
  and to the right edge (`padding-right:14px`) — opens the habit and
  greys the whole row. Before this, the 14px left padding, the 12px gap
  and the strips above/below the label text were dead zones that greyed
  the row but did nothing. The press-grey JS bails on
  `closest('input,.cali-tick')`, and Skip's swipe start check uses the
  tick zone's right edge instead of the checkbox's. One-time rows
  (`onceRow`) and tracker rows (`ciTracker`) are NOT split — a one-time
  row's label already ticks it. (Tracker rows became split rows too in
  2.92 — see the dailyItems entry above.)
  Since 2.92 every habit bar that opens a page ends in Settings' right
  arrow (`CALI_CHEV`, a `.cali-chev` span that forwards its tap to the
  label, so it's part of the bar). The
  trailing element carries the row's 14px right edge (label has no right
  padding of its own).
  Regression from the 2.89 split, found in 2.92: `paintCheck` found the
  label with `cb.nextElementSibling` — empty once the checkbox moved into
  `.cali-tick`, so ticked habits silently lost their strike-through for
  three releases. Now `row.querySelector('label')`. When wrapping an
  element in a new container, grep for sibling/parent navigation from it
  (`nextElementSibling`, `previousSibling`, `parentNode`), not just
  selectors.
  Rule since 2.90 (asked for directly): the pressed grey only shows on
  rows that OPEN something (a window/sheet or a page). Habit bars (habit
  page), tracker rows (tracker page), task rows `.ti`/`.wri` (TaskSheet)
  grey; one-time tasks have nothing to open, so neither `.cali[data-once]`
  (Today/Daily, excluded in the press-grey JS) nor `.ti[data-once]`
  (Tasks > Calendar, excluded in the `.ti:active` CSS rule) grey. A NEW
  row type with a press-grey needs the same question asked: does a tap
  open anything? If not, no grey.
  Same rule for Settings-style rows (2.93): an `.opt-row` holding a
  `.switch` does nothing itself (only the switch toggles), so the
  `.opt-row:active` grey is `:not(:has(.switch))`. (A structural `:has()`
  like this is fine; it's `:has(input:active)` — a live touch state —
  that proved unreliable on-device.)
  2.95 — task rows (`.ti`/`.wri`) work like habit rows: two zones split
  at `tickEdge(row)` (a habit's `.cali-tick` right edge, or a task's
  checkbox right edge + 6px). A delegated click on the row's own padding
  ticks (tick zone, not in hold mode) or opens the task (clicks the
  `TaskSheet.open` element) — padding used to be a dead zone. ONE press-
  grey IIFE ("Press grey for task and habit rows") drives `.pressed-row`
  for `.cali/.ti/.wri`: never in the tick zone, never on one-time tasks,
  and only after `PRESS_DELAY` (110ms) with any >10px
  movement cancelling it — so a swipe-to-skip never flashes grey (asked
  for: "a slight delay to the grey… when I start sliding it doesn't come
  but if I hold then it goes grey"); a tap shorter than the delay still
  flashes for `PRESS_TAP_MS`. Skip's swipe-start check uses `tickEdge`
  too. The old `.ti:active:not(:has(input:active))` rule is gone.
  3.30: once a row has turned grey from being HELD (the PRESS_DELAY timer
  fired — `_pressHeld`), that touch can't start a swipe-to-skip any more
  (asked for: "a higher quality feel"); and a starting swipe cancels a
  pending grey (`_pressCancel`), so no grey appears mid-swipe.
  Press-grey timing for EVERY greying element is one CSS block ("Press grey
  timing"): fade in .2s on the pressed state (`:active`/`.pressed-row`),
  and on the resting state `.4s` fade-out after a `.15s` linger — a
  transition takes the timing of the state it's going TO, which is what
  makes the linger possible even for plain `:active`. New greying
  elements need adding to both selector lists there.
  2.98 — Settings-style rows (`.opt-row`, not switch rows) moved onto the
  same JS `.pressed-row` IIFE, asked for as "the slide and grey animation
  in Today is perfect, make Settings the same". The page slide itself was
  already identical (both go through navForward, 280ms; page renders
  measured <1ms either way) — the felt difference was the grey: plain
  `:active` starts instantly and starts fading the moment the finger
  lifts, i.e. exactly when the slide begins, so a quick tap never reached
  full grey; the JS version holds a full flash for PRESS_TAP_MS into the
  slide. When two things "feel" different but share their animation
  code, compare what runs AROUND the animation before touching it.
  3.2 — "some Settings rows don't go grey": every row matched the press
  selector; the misses were rows whose tap REDRAWS their own list
  (Appearance Light/Dark/System re-render via renderAppearance, "Reset
  skipped tasks" via renderSettings) — TAPPABLE's click runs on touchend,
  the row element with `.pressed-row` is replaced by a fresh copy, and the
  grey goes with it. Fix (generic, in the press IIFE): 50ms after
  touchend, if the pressed row is detached, the row now at the touch point
  gets the grey — only if it has the same `onclick` (so a different row
  moving into the spot, e.g. after a Trash restore, doesn't flash); a row
  that was already fully grey is re-greyed instantly (`.press-now` =
  transition:none) and then fades out. Also: rows holding a dropdown
  (`.dsel-wrap`: Language, Day starts at, the Task window's Priority/
  Project…) no longer grey at all, by request — like switch rows, the
  control is the dropdown, not the row. Selector is `PRESS_ROWS`.
  To find which rows "don't do X", enumerate them all and test each
  (`.click()` with navigation/dialogs stubbed, then check
  `document.body.contains(row)`) instead of guessing from one.
  3.5 — the same thing again, on rows that NAVIGATE: opening Today/
  Overview/Statistics from Settings runs `_renderPage` -> renderSettings(),
  which rebuilt the Settings list itself too, replacing the tapped row
  while the new page slid in over the touch point (so the point-based
  carry-over couldn't find the copy). Root fix: renderSettings writes its
  three list containers through `setHTML(id,html)`, which only touches
  the DOM when the HTML changed — unchanged rows survive. The carry-over
  also now finds the copy by `onclick` anywhere (preferring the one under
  the finger, else only if it's the single match). Any render function
  that runs on navigation and rebuilds the page you're LEAVING will cause
  this; prefer setHTML-style "only if changed" writes there.
  3.10 — "the grey in Settings still feels a touch weaker than Today's":
  color, fade timings and slide were measured identical. The real
  difference was WHO clicks: Today's rows open on the browser's own click,
  which comes a moment after touchend, so the grey gets a head start before
  the slide; Settings' `.opt-row`s were clicked by TAPPABLE synchronously
  inside touchend, so the slide started in the same frame as the grey.
  Rows that grey (`PRESS_ROWS` with an onclick) are now left to the native
  click (TAPPABLE skips them), same path as Today by construction. The
  carry-over now waits for that click (capture listener, 300ms fallback)
  instead of a fixed 50ms. When two things "feel" different but measure
  the same, compare which code path triggers them, not just the timings.

- Stats/habit-detail progress ring (`renderPieChart`): fully round ends
  (`stroke-linecap="round"`) were called cheap-looking, flat ends (2.89)
  too spiky, and a gap between done and skipped (2.90) disliked too. Now
  (2.91): segments are filled paths (`ringSegment(f0,f1,col,rs,re)`), only
  the ring's two OUTER ends are rounded by `RING_CORNER` (2.5 = a quarter
  of the ring's 10-unit thickness), and done→skipped is a flat cut with
  no gap, "like the stacked bars in the bar chart". The skipped segment is
  drawn first and reaches a hair (EPS) under the green where they meet
  (and under green's start at 100%) so two shapes sharing an edge don't
  show an anti-aliasing seam. A stroke can only do sharp or fully round
  ends, hence the path. The corner radius shrinks on very short segments
  so corners never overlap (1% still renders as a sliver); a single color
  at 100% is a plain closed ring. Side benefit over round caps: the arc
  length is exact.

- Adding things on a project page (2.91): the header "+" (`TabPlus.tap`)
  opens a slide-up window instead of revealing an inline bar under the
  list — asked for as "a full new window". Tasks: the same Task window
  used for editing, `TaskSheet.openNew(pid)` (key stays null until Save,
  which calls `DB.addTask` then `updateTask` for notes). Trackers:
  `TrackerAddSheet` (title = tracker name, unit shown inside the field).
  Enter saves in both. The old inline bars (`addwrap-`, `trk-addwrap-`,
  priority pills `.pri-row/.pri-pill`, `selPri`, `A.addTask`,
  `.trk-addinp`) were removed outright; `.addrow/.addinp/.addbtn` stay
  because Daily's category sheet still uses them. The Task window has no
  Project row since 3.73 ("I'm never gonna move a task to another project";
  TaskSheet.moveToPid/setProject and DB.moveTask were removed), so a task
  always stays in its project. It hides
  its Priority row (and the then-empty card) when the project is a List, in both add
  and edit mode — List projects don't sort by priority.
  4.13 layout (asked for: "the title also in a white widget, the prio on
  the same level, small, on the right"): `.ts-head` = the name input as a
  white 48px widget (17/700) + `#task-sheet-rows.ts-pri`, a small white
  card holding only the priority dropdown (no "Priority" label; hidden
  for Lists, then the name is full width). Notes box min-height 26vh (was
  34vh). While typing in a notes box, the keyboard code's `reveal()` keeps
  the CARET's line (`_caretBottom(ta)`: a hidden mirror div with the same
  box + text up to selectionEnd) 16px above the keyboard; before it only
  kept the box's first 88px in view (KbFit.end), so typing ran under the
  keyboard once the box grew. The autosize's style change reaches `sync`
  through the sheet's MutationObserver, so every typed line re-checks.
  Verified with visualViewport.height overridden to 54% of the screen.
  3.9 — that change broke "+" on every project created before project
  types existed: those have NO `type` saved (everything else treats that
  as a to-do list), and TabPlus required `type==='todo'||'list'`, so they
  fell through to Overview's "Category / Project" choice. `DB._migrate`
  now sets `type:'todo'` on untyped projects (not the Daily project), and
  TabPlus opens the Task window for anything that isn't a tracker. Real
  data is older than the preview's blank data — when a new check keys on
  a field, ask whether old saves have that field at all.

- The update screen (`UpdateOverlay`) counts as an open overlay
  (`_overlayCount`, `_lockBodyScroll`) since 2.91 — it wasn't a
  `.sheet-overlay`, so the page behind it could be scrolled while it
  downloaded. Any other full-screen, non-sheet overlay needs the same.

- Overview minimal layout (3.69, Menu > Overview > "Minimal layout",
  `settings.overviewMinimal`, default off — "so I still have access to the
  old version"): renderGrids toggles `#p-overview.ov-min`; CSS drops the
  card background and the count line (`.acnt`), four columns, 60px icons,
  name under the icon — like a phone home screen. (Project emoji size, 4.9,
  "a bit bigger compared to the square": 32px in the normal 58px `.aico`,
  33px in the minimal 60px one — were 27/28px.) Tiles use
  `solidTintStyle()` (the tint blended opaque over the card colour) there,
  because the see-through tintStyle looked muddy on the grey page. Press
  dims the icon instead of greying a card; a dragged project gets its
  shadow on the icon (`.acard.dragging` box-shadow is turned off). The War
  Room card and category titles are unchanged.
  3.70: each tile has a thin outline. 0.34px (1 device px, ink) was "I
  can't see it"; 0.67px (2 device px, 3.71) looked thicker at the round
  corners than along the sides — the border IS one width all round, but
  the screen smooths a curve across neighbouring pixels, and a very thin
  dark line smoothed that way reads heavier. 3.78: 1px (3 device px on an
  iPhone, a whole CSS px) in the project's own colour at full strength
  (inline `border-color` from `solidTintStyle`; the tile is its pastel),
  which makes that effect much smaller. If corners are reported heavier
  again, that's anti-aliasing, not uneven geometry — a thicker or lighter
  line is the lever, not the radius.
  3.80: the ring is an `::after` overlay on top of the tile (inset 0, 1px,
  `--ring` from solidTintStyle, radius inherit), not the tile's border. As
  a border, a project PHOTO sat inside it (58px, `border-radius:inherit` =
  the outer 15px) — rounder than the border's 14px inner curve, so a light
  gap showed in every corner ("the ring doesn't align with the picture in
  the corner"). Now the photo fills the whole tile and the ring covers its
  edge. Any future outline over content that must meet it exactly: draw it
  on top, don't wrap the content in a border.
  `fitMinimalGrid()` (after renderGrids, and on resize) sets the four
  columns to a whole, even number of px plus a whole-px left margin, so
  tiles start on whole pixels (1fr columns were 78.25px → outline between
  pixels, soft/uneven); the minimal `.acard` has no border (the normal
  card's invisible 1.5px border offset the tile by half a pixel).
- Overview project tiles in DARK mode (4.21, "a nuthair brighter"): the
  colour at `TILE_DARK_A` 0x36 (21%) — `tintStyle(col,true)` for the
  normal tile and `solidTintStyle` for the minimal one; project badges in
  task rows keep `tintStyle(col)` at 0x2e (18%). Light mode unchanged.
- Project cards on Overview (`.acard`) don't scale down on press (removed
  `.acard:active{transform:scale(.95)}`, 2.91) — only the grey press
  color remains. Dragging still scales up via `.dragging`.

- Dates next to page titles look the same everywhere (2.91): Today's
  `#tlbl` and Daily's `#wlbl` are both `.tlbl` (13/500 grey), right of the
  title, format `toLocaleDateString('de-CH',{weekday:'short',day:
  'numeric',month:'short'})`. Daily's title row is `.hh-titlerow` (title
  button + date); its date follows the selected day (`updWL`). The two
  TITLES still differ by design system (Today is a tab page, 20px; Daily
  a pushed page, 26px).

- The weekday picker in the habit add/edit sheet (`#daily-item-days`,
  `.type-grid.days .type-btn.active`) uses the same full `--ink` fill with
  `--card` text as the selected day on Daily's day strip (`.dpill.sel`),
  not the blue tint the other `.type-btn` option buttons use (2.89, asked
  to match "the full black fill"). Other `.type-btn` pickers (project
  type etc.) still use the blue tint — only day selection was asked for.

- Statistics (2.99) is laid out like a Settings page: `#p-stats` has the
  `.sp` class (Settings row sizing), `.sl` section labels, 14px between
  cards; best/worst are one-line `.opt-row`s in an `.opt-group` with an
  `.opt-ico` (green triangle up / red triangle down since 3.0 — trend
  lines were too busy), score and arrow
  (`Stats.habitRow`), tapping opens the habit page (`HabitDetail.open`,
  origin 'stats') or a tracked project's page (`_trackerOrigin='stats'`);
  back and swipe-back return to Statistics via `_backTarget`, and
  `TabBar.current` keeps the Stats tab lit on both (also lights Today for
  a tracker opened from Today, which used to light Overview). White cards
  (`.calsec`) have no border anywhere now — Statistics, habit pages and
  tracker pages still carried an invisible 1.5px one. Stat text uses
  `.stat-note` (paragraph role 13/500 grey) and `.stat-num` (32/700, like
  a tracker's value) on Statistics, habit pages and tracker pages alike.
  The "One-time tasks" section (average completed per day, from
  `DB.data.archived` entries' `dateISO`) was removed from Statistics in
  3.1 "for now" — markup, render code and `oneTimeTaskStats()` all went
  (see commit history to bring it back). `dateISO` is still recorded on
  every completion, so the history is intact if it returns.
  Empty states (3.24): right after a statistics reset every habit starts
  today and today only counts once ticked, so nothing is scored yet —
  that used to show "No scheduled habits yet." (ring, best, worst), which
  read as if the habits were gone. `Stats.emptyText()` says "No data yet"
  when scheduled habits exist, and keeps "No scheduled habits yet." only
  when there are none.

- Back navigation (3.7) follows real history: `Nav.go` pushes the page
  you're leaving onto `Nav.stack`; `_backTarget()` returns the last entry
  that still exists (skipping e.g. a deleted project); arriving back —
  via navBack or the swipe-back gesture — calls `_popTo(target)`;
  `TabBar.go` (switching tabs) clears it. `TabBar.current()` lights the tab
  the history started on (`Nav.stack[0]`). The older fixed rules
  (SETTINGS_SUBPAGES -> Settings, HabitDetail.origin, _projFromDaily/
  _trackerOrigin, default Overview) remain only as a fallback when there's
  no history (e.g. right after the app reopens). Asked for as "always go
  back to the page before" — e.g. Settings > Overview > Edit layout used to
  jump back to Settings. New navigation should go through `Nav.go` (not
  navForward directly) or it won't be in the history.

- The edge swipe-back (touchstart in its IIFE) does nothing while any
  slide-up or pop-up is open (`_overlayCount>0`, 3.73 — it used to slide the
  page behind an open sheet while the sheet was being pulled closed), and
  never starts on a chart (`.zchart`, which scrolls sideways itself).
- Page slides (3.6), after "holding a Settings row long then letting go
  makes the slide stutter; Today is fine": (1) nothing prevented a second
  navForward/navBack while a slide ran — two slide loops each rewrite the
  pages' transforms every frame and fight. `_slideStart()` now ignores a
  navigation while one is running (guard self-expires after 700ms so it
  can't block for good; `Nav.go` doesn't record a skipped one), and
  `_slideEnd()` releases it. (2) the status-bar blur (backdrop-filter +
  mask) re-blurs whatever moves under it every frame — heavy on iOS — and
  a long hold that drifts a few px (still a tap: TAPPABLE's threshold is
  10px) scrolls the scrollable Settings page just enough to switch it on
  as the slide starts; Today is usually too short to scroll. `body.sliding`
  now hides the blur (display:none) for the whole slide, and `_slideEnd`
  settles its `.on` state from the final scroll position before showing it
  again (no fade flash). Which of the two caused the reported stutter
  can't be told from the preview; both are fixed. The interactive
  swipe-back runs its own `_slideUnit` and isn't guarded.
  4.10 REVERSED part (2), with phone screenshots: swiping back into a
  scrolled Overview showed the cards sharp under the clock and the blur
  only popped in after the swipe ("unclean and looks cheap… it should
  always be there"). `body.sliding` and its display:none are gone;
  `_blurDuring(a,b)` turns the blur on at the START of navBack and of the
  swipe-back when either page has content under the status bar
  (scrollTop>4 — the target's restored scroll counts); every end (done,
  or a cancelled swipe snapping back) runs `_syncBlur()`. navForward needs
  nothing: the leaving page's state already holds, the new page starts at
  the top. Not "always on" at rest on purpose: over a flat page the dark
  tint rgba(26,25,23,.35) + saturate(180%) on #1f2937 would draw a visible
  band. If the 3.6 stutter comes back, the blur during slides is the
  suspect — but the user chose the blur being there.

- Page-open/close slide (`navForward`/`navBack`, via `_slideUnit`) was
  160ms forward / 180ms back — reported as feeling too quick, wanted
  slower and more graceful. Both bumped to 280ms, then 320ms in 3.8
  (`SLIDE_MS`, "a tiny bit slower") (same ease-out-cubic
  curve, untouched). Deliberately left the swipe-back gesture's own
  `_slideUnit` calls (the 120ms ones, for the interactive drag-release
  snap) alone — those are driven by the finger leaving the screen, not a
  tap, and the request was specifically about tapping into/out of a page.

- A tracker-linked Daily item (`ciTracker()`) renders on BOTH Today and
  Daily now (since 2.53), sharing one function — but `_projFromDaily`
  (set right before navigating to the tracker's project page, so back
  knows to return to Habits instead of Overview) only ever pointed at
  Habits, regardless of which page the tap actually came from. Tapping a
  tracked habit on TODAY and swiping back landed on Habits/Daily instead
  of Today. Fixed with a second variable, `_trackerOrigin` ('today' or
  'habits', derived from `ciTracker`'s existing `editable` flag — true
  only when rendered by Daily), read by `_backTarget()` instead of the
  hardcoded 'habits'. Any future page that both renders a tracker link
  AND isn't Today or Daily needs to set this explicitly too, the same
  way `HabitDetail.origin` already tracks it for the habit detail page.

- DELETED HABITS IN STATISTICS (4.29, "if it gets deleted it looks like the
  habit was never done… a setting under Statistics… a list of active and
  deleted habits included in the stats, where I can remove deleted ones"):
  Statistics used to count only `dailyItems`, so deleting a habit
  recalculated every past day without it. Now Menu > Statistics > Deleted
  habits > "Keep in statistics" (`settings.keepDeletedHabits`, default ON):
  `DB.deleteDailyItem` (every habit delete path: the habit window, deleting
  or resetting a Habits project) first calls `_endHabit` — a COPY of the
  item goes to `DB.data.endedHabits` with `ended` (first day it no longer
  counts: today, or tomorrow if it was already done today; nothing kept for
  a habit made today and not done) and `name`; the habit still goes to the
  Trash as before, and its ticks were never deleted (same id). Statistics
  reads `statsHabits()` (dailyItems + endedHabits whose tracker still
  exists) and `habitCountsOn(it,ds)` (created ≤ ds < ended): the ring
  (`aggHabitConsistency`), the chart (`chartSource(null)`/`_sumDays`) and
  the perfect streak; `habitConsistency` honours `ended`. Best/worst stay
  live habits only (my call: you can't act on a deleted one). Restoring the
  habit from the Trash drops its copy; "Reset all statistics" empties
  endedHabits; a tracker project's deletion removes its link habit without
  keeping it (its values went with the tracker). New widget `habits`
  (STAT_WIDGETS, last): live habits in Overview order (score like best/
  worst, project name under it with 2+ Habits projects, tap = page), then
  "Deleted" rows (date range, all-time score, `.sh-x` → Alert → 
  `DB.dropEndedHabit`). `.sh-x` is in TAPPABLE (else the row swallowed the
  tap — the .switch/.dsel-real lesson), and `.sh-ended` rows are out of
  PRESS_ROWS (they open nothing). Tested: past chart columns identical
  before/after a delete, finger-style tap on ×, restore, setting off,
  export keeps endedHabits.
- Chart bar corners scale with the bar (4.29, "when the bars are really
  thin the top is basically a half circle"): ZChart `rx=min(4,bw*0.28)`
  (was min(4,bw/2)) — identical at the 14-day view (bw 14.5 → 4) and wider;
  45-day bars (4.5 wide) get 1.2 instead of 2.25. Tracker bar chart
  `r=min(3,bw/6,h/2)` (a full 18-wide bar keeps 3).
- NAME PER DAY (4.28, "workout is one habit but one day I can call it
  chest day, other pull day… the title stays the current name"): a habit
  (not a tracker habit — its name is the tracker's) can have
  `it.dayNames` = {weekday 0=Mon: name} and `it.perDay` (the switch). Only
  the ROWS use it, via `habitDayName(it,pi)` (pi = day offset → wIdx):
  Today (`ci`) and the Habits project's day panels (`ciEdit`). The habit
  page title, Statistics best/worst (`habitName`), Trash, templates' dedupe
  keep `it.text`. In DailyItemSheet: a "Name per day" switch under Days
  (`#daily-item-pd`, opt-group like the tracker chart switches), then one
  `.pd-card` with a `.pd-row` per SELECTED day (day + borderless input,
  placeholder = the main name, kept in sync by `syncPh`). Names typed for an
  unselected day, or with the switch off, are kept (`_applyPerDay` saves
  trimmed non-empty names; perDay only when on) — turning it back on brings
  them back. Rows are not `.opt-row` on purpose (no TAPPABLE/press grey on
  a row that holds a text field). Export round trip checked (dayNames
  survives `_prep`/unpack).
- Regular (non-tracker) habits can now have an optional `desc` on the
  `dailyItems` entry, edited in `DailyItemSheet` (hidden, like the name
  field, when `trackerPid` is set — a tracked project's own description
  covers that case) and shown under the title on the habit's own page
  (`#hd-desc`, hidden when empty). Deleting a habit moved from a
  standalone trash icon on every Daily row (`ciEdit`) into a Delete
  button inside this same edit sheet (`DailyItemSheet.remove`, editId-
  gated) — `ciEdit` no longer renders one. `ciTracker`'s row keeps its
  own inline trash icon: a tracker link has no edit sheet of its own to
  hold a Delete button, so removing its only delete path would leave it
  stuck in Daily permanently.

- TASK ORDER (4.27, "like habits, a universal order for all tasks, and one
  project-specific… new ones at the top or bottom of their priority…
  drag them around in Tasks and in the projects"): priority still comes
  first everywhere; the order only counts WITHIN a priority. Two orders:
  (1) per project = `extraTasks[pid]` array order (kept sorted by priority
  by `_sortTasks`, a stable sort); (2) across all projects =
  `DB.data.taskOrder` (every task key once) — used by the Tasks tab, Today
  (`todayTopTasks`: priority, then earlier-skipped first, then this) and
  the War Room box. `DB.syncTaskOrder()` keeps it exact (drops gone keys,
  appends unknown ones in the old for..in order — so the first load after
  the update shows the same order as before; it runs in `_migrate`),
  `DB.taskRank()` gives key → index for sorting. New task (`addTask`), a
  priority change (`updateTask`) and a Trash restore (`restoreTask`) go
  through `_placeTask`: bottom or top of the priority in BOTH orders,
  Menu > Tasks > New tasks (`settings.newTaskPos` 'bottom' default / 'top';
  the only setting, none in Overview). Dragging: `wireTaskDrag(cardList,
  same,pidOf,redraw)` → `DB.moveTask(pid|null,key,before,after)` moves only
  the dragged task (like moveDailyItem). Tasks tab: one card per priority,
  pid null = the order across projects. Project page: its own order, with
  DragReorder `opts.same:'data-pri'` (an item only swaps with rows having
  the same attribute value — a task can't leave its priority; a List has
  no constraint). Tasks > List view: `same:'data-pid'`, each list's own
  order (that view also lists NO_CAT lists now — it used categoryOrder
  only, so lists without a category were missing since 4.14). Today's
  rows are NOT draggable (not asked; they're swipe rows). DragReorder's
  tick-zone guard covers `.ti` too (holding the tick box never lifts a
  task — matters in hold-to-complete mode, where the checkbox has
  pointer-events:none and the row is the target). A lifted `.ti` gets the
  card colour (`.card-list .ti` is transparent otherwise). Tested with
  finger-style touches: drag in Tasks / project / List view, the priority
  boundary, the tick zone, migration order unchanged. Testing note: after
  an update, the What's New sheet covers the screen — close it before
  dispatching touches (elementFromPoint hit the overlay).
- Overview projects drag ACROSS categories (4.22, "drag them anywhere you
  want into other categories"): ONE DragReorder on #overview-grid (wired
  once) with opts `{cross:true, zoneSel:'[data-cat]>.agrid', flipSel:
  '.acard,.shdr', bodyClass:'proj-drag'}` replaces the per-category .agrid
  wiring. Cross mode (`_hitCross`): over another card's middle 60% the
  placeholder goes next to it (same grid: swap like before; other grid:
  before/after by which half the finger is in); over an empty part of a
  grid it goes to that grid's end. `_flip` animates every card AND
  category title. `_edgeScroll`: a finger within 70px of the page's
  top/bottom scrolls it (rAF, up to 12px/frame) and re-hits. Every group
  ALWAYS renders its grid now; an empty one is `.agrid.zone-empty` — no
  height/margin at rest (measured: layout identical), and while
  body.proj-drag a 72px faint slot (55% card colour) with the normal 22px
  margin, so empty categories and the no-category area can be dropped
  into. On drop `DB.setProjectGroups({key:[pids]})` writes every group from
  the screen and sets each project's categoryId (entries that aren't real
  projects, e.g. legacy 'habits', are kept at the end of their group),
  then renderGrids. The -2px War Room rule skips a zone-empty grid (else a
  0-height zone would pull the first category up 2px). Without opts
  (Daily habits) DragReorder runs exactly the old code path — tested.
- Drag-to-reorder (2.84, `DragReorder`): long-press (`DRAG_HOLD_MS`: 450ms, 900ms
  since 3.20 — "double the time", cancelled by
  >10px movement before then) picks an item up — `position:fixed`, a
  `.dragging` class (scale+shadow, no shiver by request), tracked to the
  finger — then swaps it past whichever sibling it overlaps on drop.
  `DragReorder.init(container, handleSel, itemSel, mode, onDrop)` is
  generic: `handleSel` is what has to be PRESSED to start a drag (a whole
  card, or just a category's title text so the title can drag the whole
  block); `itemSel` is what actually gets picked up (the nearest ancestor
  matching it from the handle). One `container` per sibling group is what
  scopes a drag — Overview wires each category's own `.agrid` separately
  for its projects (so a project can't be dragged into a different
  category this way), and the whole `#overview-grid` once for `.cat-block`
  category reordering. Daily wires every day panel's own `.calsec`
  (harmless to wire all of them — a `display:none` panel's rows never
  receive touches anyway) for habit reordering within a category.
  3.12 — ONE universal habit order, asked for as "if meditation is above
  reading it's always above reading… changing it on one day changes it
  everywhere": `dailyItems`' array order IS that order (every day panel
  and Today list habits in array order, filtered by day). The old
  `DB.reorderDailyItems` put the visible (dragged-day) habits first and
  appended every habit NOT shown that day after them, so a drag on Monday
  pushed Tuesday-only habits to the bottom of their category — the order
  shifted on other days. Replaced by `DB.moveDailyItem(id,beforeId,
  afterId)`: only the dragged habit moves, to right before the visible
  habit now below it (or right after the one above it when dropped last);
  everything else keeps its place. DragReorder's onDrop now also gets the
  dragged element (`onDrop(container,el)`). Never rebuild the whole list
  from what one day shows — that day doesn't show every habit.
  Two real bugs from writing this, worth not repeating: (1) suppressing
  the tap TAPPABLE (the generic touch-feedback IIFE) would otherwise still
  fire on release used `stopPropagation()` from a SEPARATE listener on the
  dragged element — which also silently ate the drag engine's OWN
  `touchend` listener, since that one was on `document` and never got to
  fire once propagation stopped. Fixed by binding the drag's own
  touchmove/touchend/touchcancel straight to the element instead of
  `document` (touch events always keep targeting whatever element
  touchstart actually hit, no matter where the finger goes, so this works
  and lets `_end` itself call `stopPropagation()` after doing its own job,
  with nothing downstream left to accidentally cut off). (2)
  `wireOverviewDrag()` runs at the end of every `renderGrids()` call (task
  completion, project add/edit/delete, tab switches — very frequent), and
  initially called `DragReorder.init` on `#overview-grid` itself every
  time — that container is NOT recreated by `innerHTML=h` (only its
  children are), so every call stacked another duplicate listener on the
  same persistent element, each independently firing `_begin()`/`_end()`
  for one gesture and stepping on each other's state in the shared
  `DragReorder` singleton (`_end` reading `this._el` after a previous
  duplicate call had already nulled it — `Cannot read properties of null`).
  Fixed with a `dataset.dragWired` guard so that specific container is
  only ever wired once; the per-category `.agrid`s and Daily's `.calsec`s
  genuinely ARE fresh elements every render, so they need no such guard.
  3.93: releasing a picked-up item must NEVER open it ("when I let it go
  and haven't moved it, it opens the project"). `_end` already
  preventDefault()s + stopPropagation()s the touchend, and in the preview
  (synthetic touches) nothing opened — but the iPhone still produced a
  click. Not reproducible here, so fixed by construction: `_end` stamps
  `DragReorder._endedAt`, and a document CAPTURE click listener swallows
  clicks from then until the NEXT touchstart (capture listener resets it),
  at most 1s — i.e. only clicks produced by the released finger. 3.93 used
  a flat 600ms instead and ate a real quick tap right after letting go
  ("I click right after, nothing happens"); 3.94 scoped it to the gesture.
  Covers all drag users (Overview projects/categories, Daily habits,
  Statistics widgets). Checked: release click blocked, a new tap 100ms
  later opens.
  3.23: holding a project PHOTO (an <img>, not an emoji) on Overview
  started iOS's own image drag — only the picture moved, the card didn't.
  Project photos (`iconOrPhoto`) are `.proj-photo` (pointer-events:none,
  draggable=false) so the touch lands on the card; all imgs also get
  `-webkit-user-drag:none`. Any new <img> inside something draggable or
  tappable needs the same.
  3.11: a habit row is picked up only from its BAR — a touch in the tick
  zone (`input`, or x <= `tickEdge(row)`, the same split as the press
  grey) never primes a drag (DragReorder.init's touchstart). Before, a
  hold on the tick box both ticked (hold-to-complete) and started a drag.
  Only verified via synthetic `Touch`/`TouchEvent` dispatch in this desktop
  preview (real long-press timing and drag physics need a real phone) —
  one thing that surfaced there and is worth knowing before "debugging" it
  again: this preview's `setTimeout` gets throttled to ~1s regardless of
  the requested delay whenever the tab isn't the foregrounded/focused one,
  which looked exactly like swap-oscillation until dispatching moves
  back-to-back (no artificial delay) confirmed the swap logic itself was
  already stable — a `_lastSwapWith`/`_lastSwapAt` 250ms cooldown on
  re-swapping the same pair is still in there as a real safety net against
  a swap's own reflow shifting the target enough to immediately re-trigger
  itself, just wasn't what that particular test artifact was showing.
  Follow-up (2.85), asked for explicitly ("they should move and make
  place like on Samsung/Google phones"): the swap above worked (the data
  order was correct) but nothing ever visibly SLID — because `el` is
  `position:fixed` the whole drag, which removes it from grid/list flow
  entirely; the siblings already did their one-time, unanimated reflow
  to close its gap the moment `_begin()` made it fixed, and reordering a
  fixed element's DOM position among them afterward changes nothing
  further about their layout no matter how many times it happens — so
  the FLIP diff always measured zero movement. Fixed by leaving a plain
  invisible `.drag-placeholder` (same size) in `el`'s spot instead: `el`
  still floats fixed on top same as before, but it's the PLACEHOLDER —
  a genuine flow participant — that actually gets swapped among the real
  siblings, which now truly reflows them and gives the FLIP diff real
  deltas to animate. `_end` swaps `el` back in for the placeholder at
  drop.
  This preview's `requestAnimationFrame` doesn't fire at all during
  `javascript_exec` calls (confirmed separately — a counter incremented
  in an rAF loop stayed at 0 after a real 300ms wait), on top of the
  `setTimeout` throttling already noted above — so the FLIP animation's
  before-offset was verified correct (a real `translate()` delta showed
  up immediately after a swap, proving the placeholder approach fixed
  the "nothing moves" bug) but the animation's OWN cleanup (the thing
  that's supposed to release the offset with a transition so it slides
  rather than snaps) could only be verified by manually flushing a
  monkey-patched rAF queue, not by actually watching a frame render. If
  a future report says the slide still just snaps instead of easing, get
  that confirmed on a real device before assuming this code is at fault
  — this preview cannot exercise that path at all.
  Also from this same round: don't trust `navigate`-ing this file to a
  new `?v=N` query as a clean reset between test scenarios — this file
  lives outside the configured preview root and renders as a static
  `data:` snapshot (confirmed: `localStorage` throws `SecurityError:
  Storage is disabled inside 'data:' URLs` here), and `DB.data` kept
  accumulating projects/categories added by earlier `javascript_exec`
  calls across what looked like separate navigations. `DB.data=DB._blank()`
  at the start of a test scenario is what actually gets a clean slate.
  The same goes for monkey-patches: a test that wrapped
  `A.toggleDailyItemFor` and then threw before restoring it left the
  wrapper installed across a `navigate`, and a second test's
  `var orig=...` (global scope, same name) turned the old wrapper into
  one that called itself — "Maximum call stack size exceeded" and ticks
  that never saved, which looked exactly like an app bug and wasn't.
  Wrap test code in an IIFE (no globals), restore patches in `finally`,
  and when a result looks impossible, check `fn.toString()` for a leftover
  wrapper first. Closing the tab and opening a new one (`tabs_close` +
  `preview_start`) is the only reliable full reset. Also: in "Hold to
  complete" mode a plain tap on a habit deliberately doesn't tick — check
  that setting before concluding that ticking is broken (it's OFF on a
  fresh install since 4.15, but old test data may have it on).
  `location.reload()` doesn't reload this preview's data: snapshot (a
  marker variable survives it), and a tab can't be put into the mobile
  preset before its first load — so code that decides "is this iOS" at
  load time always sees desktop here. To test such a path, eval the real
  block from `document.scripts[0].textContent` with only the flag line
  replaced (2.97 did this for the keyboard tap takeover).
  Screenshots only show what the pane last PAINTED: when the Browser pane
  is hidden (`document.visibilityState==='hidden'`) it stops repainting
  and every screenshot repeats the last frame even though the DOM has
  moved on — check `document.visibilityState` before trusting a
  screenshot that contradicts the DOM, and verify layout with
  getBoundingClientRect measurements instead.
  Two unrelated fixes landed in the same 2.85 pass while looking at this
  screen's presses: (a) the pressed-grey on a `.ti`/`.cali`/`.wri` row
  was appearing when pressing the CHECKBOX too, since CSS `:active`
  bubbles up from any pressed descendant — scoped it to the row itself
  with `:active:not(:has(input:active))`, since the checkbox already has
  its own tick animation and didn't need the row flashing on top of it.
  (b) a row with no border-radius of its own (by design — dividers run
  edge-to-edge) relies entirely on its card's `overflow:hidden` clip to
  look rounded at the top/bottom row — but that clip only ever cuts a
  sharp corner down to the curve, it was never actually PAINTING anything
  of its own into the sliver that sits outside that curve but inside the
  square. At rest that sliver just showed the card's own color (invisible
  — the row's rest background matched it exactly), but the row's own
  OPAQUE press-color filling it revealed whatever's behind the WHOLE
  card instead of the card's color, in every single first/last row
  across the app, not just Today (same root cause as the white-sliver
  fix two versions earlier, just the corners instead of the bottom edge).
  Fixed the same way: `:first-child`/`:last-child` on every row-in-card
  type get the matching corner radius directly, so their own fill
  reaches the true rounded boundary instead of depending on the parent's
  clip to fake it.
  That `:first-child`/`:last-child` fix itself turned out wrong for
  habits specifically (2.86, reported with a real screenshot: a MIDDLE
  row rounding at the bottom like it was last). Root cause: with Settings
  > Today > "Skip habits" turned ON, `swipeWrap()` wraps EVERY habit row
  in its own `.sw.h > .sw-row`, so each `.cali` becomes the ONLY child of
  its own individual wrapper — making it simultaneously `:first-child`
  AND `:last-child` of THAT wrapper, for every single row, all the time.
  Both radius rules then matched every row; whichever was declared later
  in the stylesheet (the `:last-child` one) won outright since border-
  radius is a single shorthand property, not four independent longhands,
  so EVERY row silently got bottom-only rounding regardless of position.
  This didn't reproduce with "Skip habits" off (the default, and what
  every test in the previous entry happened to use) since then `.cali` is
  a plain direct child of `.calsec` and the selector matches correctly —
  which is exactly why it shipped unnoticed and needed a real device
  screenshot to catch. Fixed by dropping the CSS pseudo-selector for
  `.cali` specifically and marking the true edges explicitly instead:
  `markEdgeRows(container, itemSel)` (in index.html, called after every
  `buildPanels()`/`renderToday()`) reads `container.querySelectorAll
  (itemSel)` — which finds `.cali` regardless of how deep it's nested —
  and toggles `.row-first`/`.row-last` on the actual first/last match;
  the CSS now keys off those classes for `.cali` instead of the pseudo-
  selector. Needs calling from BOTH render paths that build a `.calsec`
  of habits — Daily's `buildPanels()` (all day panels, plus its own
  `[data-cat]`-less One-time section, which `wireDailyDrag` deliberately
  skips since one-time tasks aren't reorderable — that skip must not
  also skip marking it) AND Today's separate `renderToday()` — missing
  either one leaves that screen's edge rows back to unrounded/square
  rather than wrong, but still not matching the card. Other row-in-card
  types (`.ti` in `.card-list`, `.opt-row` in `.opt-group`, etc.) still
  use the plain pseudo-selector — they don't have an equivalent per-row
  wrapping path today, but if one is ever added to any of them, it needs
  this same explicit-class treatment, not another one-off fix.
  A row ALONE in its card matches both first and last; the later
  bottom-only rule won, so e.g. a single War Room task's red stripe
  (inset box-shadow, follows the radius) was square at the top. Fixed in
  2.92 with an `:only-child` (and `.cali.row-first.row-last`) rule giving
  all four corners — every row type in that rule set is covered.

- Pages scroll inside their OWN frame (3.14), not the document: `.page` is
  `position:fixed; top:0; bottom:var(--tb-h)` with `overflow-y:auto`, and
  `.tabbar` has `height:var(--tb-h)` (since 3.41: 52px + `--tb-pad-b`, the
  full bottom safe area, min 12px — ~86px on an iPhone vs the original
  ~105px; tuned by feel: 62px "a bit too short", 70px/76px "a bit higher",
  then "+10px"; icons 27px since 3.66 — was 24px with 13px above them, now 10px above, so the bar height and label spot are unchanged; `.tab-item svg` stroke-width 1.5 in CSS keeps the lines ~1.7px thin at 27px; 10px labels), so the tab
  bar sits OUTSIDE every scroller, like a native app. Why: an on-device
  readout (iOS 18.1, 3.13) proved iOS delivers NO event at all (no
  touchstart/pointerdown/click) for the tap that stops a coasting scroll —
  with the document scrolling, the tab bar was part of it, so the first tap
  on the menu only ever stopped the scroll and no JS could react (3.10's
  touchstart switch couldn't help). Consequences: the document never
  scrolls; scroll position is `page.scrollTop` (`_saveScroll`,
  `_pageScrollY()`), saved per page in `_scrollPos` (a display:none page
  loses its scrollTop); `_fixPage/_unfix` only show/move/paint a page for a
  slide (pages are already fixed scrollers); navForward/navSwitch start the
  new page at scrollTop 0, navBack/swipe-back restore the saved one; the
  status-bar blur listens to scroll in CAPTURE phase and reads the active
  page (`_syncBlur()` after switches/slides); the sheet scroll lock
  (`_lockBodyScroll`) is `overflow-y:hidden` on the active page (also stops
  a coasting scroll; the old body position:fixed / html overflow:hidden
  modes and `_bodyLockY/_lockMode` are gone); the keyboard code undoes any
  visual pan with scrollTo(0,0). Page bottom padding is 24px (it was 118px
  to clear the tab bar; `.proj-page`'s own 118px was removed too). Known
  loss: tapping the iOS status bar no longer scrolls a page to the top
  (iOS only does that for the document). Anything new that reads or sets
  scroll must use the active page, never `window.scrollY`/`scrollTo`.

- Status-bar blur (`.statusbar-blur`, shown once the page scrolls): its
  mask used to end at 50% opacity, which drew a hard line where the blur
  stopped. Since 3.3 the mask fades fully to transparent with an eased
  curve over the last 44px, and the element is 28px taller so the
  full-strength part reaches as far as before (height was "perfect",
  only the edge was wrong). backdrop-filter and the mask must stay on the
  SAME element: a mask/opacity on a parent turns it into a backdrop root,
  and children's backdrop-filter would then have nothing to blur. The
  preview has no notch (safe-area 0) — to eyeball it, temporarily set its
  height to `calc(59px + 34px)` and put content under it.

- Data safety (3.4), after a friend on Android (Pixel, probably) lost all
  data twice "after updates". Nothing in the code deletes data on update
  (update code only drops caches/SW; storage key has been 'lifeos' in all
  291 versions; same origin), but two weak spots could turn a phone-side
  problem into a wipe: (1) `DB.load` silently fell back to an empty set if
  reading/parsing failed, and What's New saves ~0.4s after every update's
  first launch — writing that empty set over the real data; (2) the app
  never asked for persistent storage, so Android Chrome may evict the
  whole origin (data + cached app) when the phone runs low on space, and
  the next launch downloads the newest version fresh — indistinguishable
  from "wiped after an update". Now: `DB.load` sets `DB.readOnly` +
  `DB.loadProblem` ('unavailable' = storage threw, 'unreadable' = invalid
  data or a migration threw; migrations moved into `DB._migrate`) and
  `DB.save` does nothing while readOnly; unreadable text is also copied to
  'lifeos-unreadable'; `DataNotice` (a tap-to-dismiss card) says what
  happened; a throwing `setItem` (storage full) shows one notice per
  session instead of failing silently; startup calls
  `navigator.storage.persist()` if not yet persisted. NEVER reintroduce a
  code path that starts with blank data and saves after a failed read.
  Testing note: this preview blocks localStorage (data: URL), so every
  load here now starts readOnly with the 'unavailable' notice — expected.
  To test data paths, swap `window.localStorage` for a fake object via
  `Object.defineProperty(window,'localStorage',{value:fake,...})` and call
  `DB.load()`.

## Known gotchas
- A past UI change caused cascading breakage across the app — before large
  structural changes to shared components (nav, panels, layout containers),
  flag the blast radius and confirm before proceeding rather than assuming
  it's isolated.
- Single-file architecture means CSS/JS changes can have non-obvious global
  side effects — check surrounding sections after edits, not just the
  section touched.
- iOS home-screen launches can briefly flash a "No Internet Connection"
  warning even though the app is fully cached and works fine right after.
  Tried a `start.html` bootstrap page as `start_url` (theory: a WebKit
  race lets the first navigation hit the network before the SW finishes
  activating) — confirmed on a genuinely fresh install that it did NOT
  stop the warning. Reverted. Current read: this is very likely an
  iOS/WebKit-level thing outside app control, not worth chasing further.
  3.28 — a DIFFERENT, app-caused one: in airplane mode iOS showed its
  "Airplane Mode is on" alert on every launch. That alert comes up when the
  app makes any network request in airplane mode, and the automatic update
  check (`checkForUpdate(true)`, 1.2s after launch and on resume after 5
  min) fetched sw.js every time. `checkForUpdate` now returns before any
  request when `navigator.onLine===false` (a manual check says "You're
  offline"), and a skipped automatic check runs on the `online` event
  (`A._updateWhenOnline`). The app loads nothing else from the network
  (no external fonts/scripts; icons/manifest come from the SW cache). If
  the alert still shows, what's left is the browser's own service-worker
  update check on launch, which a page can't turn off. Any new network
  request must also skip itself while offline.

- sw.js's navigate handler (fetch listener, `e.request.mode === 'navigate'`)
  must ALWAYS resolve to `SHELL_URL` (index.html) — never fetch or cache
  under the literally-requested URL. This is why: a home-screen icon's
  launch URL is baked in permanently by iOS at "Add to Home Screen" time
  and can never be changed after the fact. The `start.html` experiment
  above got deleted in the revert, and any icon added while it was live
  is now permanently pointed at a URL that no longer exists on the
  server — the old handler faithfully fetched that literal dead URL and
  rendered GitHub's raw 404 page. Fixed structurally so this can't
  recur: every navigation in scope, regardless of requested URL, always
  serves/caches index.html specifically. Verified by navigating straight
  to a URL that genuinely 404s server-side and confirming it still loads
  the real app. Don't ever go back to keying cache/fetch off `e.request`
  for navigation — same class of bug, just with a different broken URL
  next time.

- The global touch-feedback IIFE near the bottom of index.html (the one
  with the `TAPPABLE` selector list) fires a synthetic `.click()` on
  `touchend` for any element matching that selector, and calls
  `e.preventDefault()` first — meaning it suppresses whatever native
  touch-to-click the browser would otherwise have produced. `.opt-row`
  is in that list. A real `<input type=checkbox>`/`<label>` toggle
  switch placed INSIDE an `.opt-row` that has no `onclick` of its own
  (the row is just a label, not a button) gets its tap hijacked anyway,
  because `closest(TAPPABLE)` walks up to the row — so the synthetic
  click lands on the non-interactive row instead of the actual control,
  and the switch does nothing. This shipped once (the "hold to
  complete" switch was completely untappable on a real phone) and
  wasn't caught by testing with mouse clicks in the browser preview,
  which don't go through this touchstart/touchmove/touchend path at
  all — only mobile-viewport-emulated taps (or a real device) exercise
  it. Fixed generically: the touchstart handler now bails out (and
  resets `target` to null, not just returns early) whenever the touch
  started inside `.switch`, letting that control handle its own tap
  natively. Any future custom interactive control nested inside a
  TAPPABLE container needs the same explicit bail-out, and needs to be
  tested with the mobile viewport preset (or real touch events), not
  just mouse clicks, or this exact bug reappears silently.
  It reappeared anyway: `.dsel-real` (the invisible, enlarged `<select>`
  behind the Language/Day starts at/Tasks shown dropdowns, added later
  to give them a bigger tap target) sits inside a TAPPABLE `.opt-row`
  with no `onclick` of its own — same shape as the switch, same bug.
  Reported as "the dropdowns don't work at all, I can't click them."
  Added `.dsel-real` to the same bail-out list (now
  `closest('.switch,.dsel-real')`). The lesson above about testing new
  controls with real/emulated touch, not mouse clicks, is exactly what
  would have caught this before shipping — didn't happen. When adding
  ANY new interactive element inside an `.opt-row`, `.acard`, or other
  TAPPABLE container, check this bail-out list first.
  3.10: rows that grey (PRESS_ROWS with an onclick) are no longer clicked
  by TAPPABLE at all (see the press-grey entry) — so a tap on them during
  a momentum scroll only stops the scroll, which the user wants ("I don't
  want to click something when I just want to stop scrolling"). The one
  exception they asked for is the tab bar: `.tab-item` clicks on TOUCHSTART
  while the page is scrolling (`_lastScrollAt` < 150ms ago), since a tap
  that stops a scroll apparently never reached touchend-based handling on
  their phone. Not scrolling, the tab bar still acts on touchend (so a
  scroll gesture that starts on the tab bar doesn't switch tabs).
  3.13: reported that this did NOT help. A TEMPORARY readout (search
  "TEMPORARY (3.13) readout": every touch/pointer/click event the tab bar
  got within 2s of a scroll) showed on iOS 18.1 that the stopping tap is
  never delivered to the page at all. Fixed structurally in 3.14 — see
  "Pages scroll inside their OWN frame" — and confirmed on the iPhone; the
  readout was removed in 3.15. The touchstart switch above stays: now that
  the tab bar is outside the scroller, it just makes the switch happen on
  touch-down while a page is still moving.

- `checkForUpdate` (index.html, `A.checkForUpdate`) went through several
  broken iterations worth knowing about: (1) originally deleted all
  caches unconditionally before confirming a fresh copy was fetchable —
  any hiccup left a blank white screen with no recovery short of
  deleting the home-screen icon; (2) even after fixing that, it still
  did a full destructive wipe+reload even when there was NO update
  available. Current version: only touches anything if `reg.update()`
  actually finds a new service worker installing — in that case it lets
  the new worker cache its own assets and activate on its own
  (skipWaiting + clients.claim, already in sw.js's own lifecycle), waits
  for `controllerchange`, shows an "Updating…" → "✓ Updated" overlay, then
  reloads. If there's no update it's a pure no-op (message only, zero
  cache/page touch). The whole thing is wrapped in a 12s watchdog timeout
  so it can never hang. Note on iOS storage: a home-screen icon has ITS
  OWN isolated localStorage/cache/SW, separate from Safari and from any
  other icon of the same site — deleting an icon without exporting first
  loses its data permanently, and Safari "working fine" tells you nothing
  about whether a given icon's storage is broken.
  (3) A real-world report from the user's own device: "check for
  updates" mostly said "already on the latest version" even though a
  real update HAD landed (confirmed because the "what's new" sheet for
  the newer version showed up on the next cold launch) — and separately,
  the progress overlay sometimes froze partway ("Almost there…") and
  needed a manual reload to recover. Both traced to the same root cause:
  this flow trusted two browser-delivered signals — the `updatefound`
  event firing essentially synchronously with `reg.update()`'s promise
  resolving, and the `controllerchange` event firing once the new worker
  actually takes over — and neither is reliable enough to trust alone,
  particularly on iOS Safari (unconfirmed exactly which part, since this
  can only be tested in a desktop/Chromium preview here, not on the
  user's real device — sw.js's own lifecycle, self.skipWaiting() +
  clients.claim(), is unconditional and was already correct). Fixed
  defensively rather than chasing the exact engine quirk: (a) after
  reg.update() resolves, wait ~350ms before concluding "no update" —
  gives a slightly-late `updatefound` a chance to still arrive; (b) once
  `updatefound` DOES fire, also poll `navigator.serviceWorker.controller`
  every 400ms as a fallback for `controllerchange` never arriving; (c)
  if even the 12s watchdog fires while we know an update was found and
  started installing, don't report "nothing was changed" (actively
  false in that case) — reload on our own instead, since the new worker
  has very likely already activated by then. If this area breaks again,
  don't add more one-off timers — get a real device to test on, or at
  minimum get the actual browser/OS version from the report before
  guessing further.

- The global touchmove handler that blocks background/body scroll while
  a sheet is open (search "Block body scroll when any overlay is open")
  reads a counter, `_overlayCount`, that's also defensively reset to 0
  on every touchstart if a "safety check" thinks nothing is actually
  open — and that check used to be a hardcoded array of specific overlay
  ids. Every `.sheet-overlay` added after that array was written (this
  has happened repeatedly — whatsnew, verhist, daily-cat, daily-item,
  add-choice, once-add, task, color) wasn't on it, so opening any of
  those always looked like "nothing open" to the safety check, zeroed
  the counter on first touch, and silently disabled the scroll-blocker —
  which is what let scrolling inside that sheet scroll the page
  underneath instead, and could make a tall sheet's own close button
  drift out of reach with no way back except reopening the app. Fixed
  by checking `document.querySelector('.sheet-overlay.on')` instead of
  a maintained list — don't go back to a hardcoded list of ids for this,
  it will silently rot the same way again the next time a sheet is added.
  That fix alone wasn't the whole bug, though — reported as still
  happening on a real device afterward. The SAME handler's ancestor walk
  treated landing on `.sheet-overlay` itself (the dimmed backdrop, not
  just `.sheet`, the actual scrollable panel) as "inside the overlay,
  leave it alone" and skipped preventDefault there too. `.sheet` is
  `max-height:90vh`, so a sheet with enough content to need scrolling
  (Version history) never reaches the very top of the screen — there's
  always a sliver of bare, non-scrollable backdrop above it, and a
  gesture starting there (easy to do reaching for the top of a long
  list) hit that unblocked path and chained straight to the page
  underneath. Narrowed the check to `.sheet` only — the backdrop has
  nothing of its own worth allowing default touch behavior for.
  Lesson for both parts of this one: a fix that only checks the class
  it saw fail (`_overlayCount`) instead of re-reading the whole
  handler's logic can leave a second, adjacent bug in the same function
  untouched — when a bug report says a fix didn't work, re-derive the
  mechanism from scratch rather than re-checking only what was already
  changed.
  Even THAT fix wasn't enough — reported as still intermittent ("it
  worked... wait now it doesn't"), and the detail that actually
  explained it: "there's a scrollbar from the background scrolling...
  only after that one disappears can I scroll in versions". That's iOS
  momentum/inertial scrolling — if the user was scrolling with any real
  velocity right as a sheet opened, the background keeps coasting
  entirely as a browser-internal animation, with no more touch events
  left for ANY handler to call preventDefault on. No touchmove-based
  approach can stop a scroll that's already committed, no matter how
  correct its touch-target logic is — that's the ceiling this whole
  approach (both attempts above) was built against without realizing
  it. Replaced the entire touchmove-interception strategy with
  `_lockBodyScroll()`/`_unlockBodyScroll()`: set `document.body`'s
  `position` to `fixed` (saving/restoring `scrollY` via `top`) for as
  long as `_overlayCount` is above 0, in `_overlayOpen`/`_overlayClose`
  themselves rather than a separate listener. A position:fixed element
  can't be mid-scroll at all, so this stops an already-in-flight
  momentum scroll dead, not just future gesture attempts — verified via
  `window.scrollTo()` while locked having no effect at all, and the
  original scroll position being restored correctly on unlock, including
  through nested opens (two overlays open at once only unlocks when the
  second one — the one that incremented the count off zero — closes).
  If background scroll during a sheet is ever reported broken again,
  don't add a fourth touchmove special case — this class of bug is why
  the fixed-position lock exists now, and if it's not enough the
  problem is somewhere else entirely (worth checking: does anything
  else in this app set `document.body.style.position` or `.top`
  directly and clobber this while it's active?).
  Immediate follow-up once the lock landed: scrolling UP to the very
  top of a sheet (Version history specifically) could break scrolling
  entirely. `.sheet` had no `overscroll-behavior`, so hitting the top
  of its own content triggered iOS's native rubber-band/scroll-chaining
  into the now-`position:fixed` body — an ancestor that can't scroll at
  all, which is exactly the kind of edge case that class of interaction
  breaks on. Added `overscroll-behavior-y:contain` to `.sheet`, which
  keeps overscroll contained inside it instead of chaining anywhere.
  While in there, also implemented what was asked instead of the
  original close-button design: `.sheet` is 75vh (was 90vh), and
  Version history specifically has no close button at all — dismiss by
  tapping the visible backdrop (`.sheet-overlay`'s own onclick, already
  existed) or by pulling down once already scrolled to the top of the
  list (new gesture, scoped to `#verhist-overlay` only via a dedicated
  touchstart/touchmove/touchend IIFE — only engages when the drag
  starts with `sheet.scrollTop<=0` and is moving downward, otherwise it
  does nothing and normal scrolling proceeds). This pattern (no close
  button, swipe-to-dismiss, backdrop tap) is scoped to Version history
  only, not the shared `.sheet` component in general — other sheets
  (Edit project, category pickers, etc.) still have real Save/Cancel
  actions and keep their explicit buttons; don't assume this same
  swipe-dismiss treatment should extend to those without being asked.
  Follow-up: the release animation felt off ("not that smooth") on a
  short drag. Cause: the drag itself tracks the finger 1:1 in px, but
  the release animated to a flat `translateY(100%)` over a flat 200ms
  regardless of how much px distance that actually was — a drag that
  barely crossed the 80px threshold still had to cover the sheet's
  full remaining height in the same 200ms as a drag that was most of
  the way there already, so it visibly sped up right as the finger
  lifted. Fixed by computing the close/snap-back duration from the
  actual remaining distance in px (clamped between ~120-280ms) instead
  of a flat number, so the release reads as a continuation of the same
  motion instead of a different, faster one taking over.

- checkForUpdate() reliability, continued: even with the grace-period/
  polling fixes above, a real device still reported "already on the
  latest version" for an update that (per the user) only landed once
  the app was fully closed and reopened. That points at a different,
  more fundamental gap than event timing: `navigator.serviceWorker
  .register('sw.js')` was called with no `updateViaCache` option, which
  defaults to `'imports'` — meaning the browser is free to satisfy
  `reg.update()`'s fetch of sw.js from its own HTTP cache instead of the
  network, so the manual check can end up byte-comparing a stale cached
  copy against itself and correctly-but-uselessly conclude "no diff",
  while the browser's own separate automatic update timing (checked on
  relaunch, on a different schedule/cache policy) fetches a genuinely
  fresh copy later and finds the real diff. Registered with
  `{updateViaCache:'none'}` instead, which forces every update check to
  skip the HTTP cache for the SW script unconditionally. This is a
  registration-time option — it takes effect the next time `register()`
  runs (every page load already calls it), not retroactively on an
  already-active registration.
  `updateViaCache:'none'` alone still wasn't enough — confirmed on the
  user's actual iPhone (home-screen icon, standalone PWA, not Safari):
  manual check kept saying "latest", relaunching the app kept quietly
  picking up the real update anyway (no progress screen, just the
  What's New sheet on next open — confirming sw.js's own lifecycle was
  never the problem, only this page's detection of it). GitHub Pages
  serves sw.js with `Cache-Control: max-age=600` — confirmed via `curl
  -I`. Two ways to read that: either this WebKit version doesn't honor
  `updateViaCache`, or it does but `reg.update()`'s internal fetch still
  isn't guaranteed to ignore a *fresh-enough* cache entry regardless of
  that flag. Either way, stopped trying to make the SPEC-level API
  behave and instead forced it directly: `fetch('sw.js',{cache:
  'no-store'})` right before every `reg.update()` call. This doesn't
  need reg.update() to do anything differently — it just makes sure the
  browser's HTTP cache entry for sw.js is genuinely current by the time
  reg.update() reads it, network-cache policy or engine quirks aside.
  If a future report says update-checking is STILL wrong after this,
  the next thing to check is whether `fetch('sw.js',...)` itself is
  even reaching the network on that device (a browser dev-tools network
  tab on the actual device/OS in question, not another guess from here)
  — this file cannot get closer to root-causing an iOS-only bug without
  one.

- This app's own service worker is deliberately cache-first (see the
  navigate-handler gotcha above), which also means the LOCAL PREVIEW used
  to test changes during a session will keep serving an old cached copy
  of index.html after an edit — a plain reload is not enough to see the
  new file. Before checking any edit in the browser preview: unregister
  the SW and clear caches in that tab (`navigator.serviceWorker
  .getRegistrations()` → unregister each, `caches.keys()` → delete each),
  THEN reload. Confirmed once by diffing `document.styleSheets` cssText
  against the actual file on disk (via curl) — the file was already
  correct, the page just hadn't picked it up yet. Skipping this step
  reads as "my fix didn't work" when it actually did.

- Every bottom sheet's opening slide-up (`.sheet-overlay` → `.sheet`,
  shared by all ~12 sheets) used to key the transform transition off the
  SAME class the overlay's own `display:none → block` flip used
  (`.sheet-overlay.on`). Reported as "slides smoothly to one level, then
  makes a small jump" on a real iPhone. Root cause: a CSS transition
  needs a real rendered "before" frame to interpolate from, and
  `display:none → block` landing in the same style recalc as the
  transform change means there IS no such frame — different browsers
  resolve that ambiguity differently. Confirmed in this desktop preview
  by sampling the sheet's `getBoundingClientRect().top` every
  `requestAnimationFrame` right after triggering open: the very first
  sample was already at the final resting value — no interpolation ran
  at all here, the browser just skipped straight to the end state. iOS
  Safari apparently resolves the same ambiguity differently (a partial
  interpolation that then snaps the remainder) — same bug, two
  different-looking symptoms; neither is reproducible as "correct"
  behavior on any engine. Fixed by splitting the two changes across two
  guaranteed-separate paint frames: `.on` alone only flips visibility
  now (sheet stays at its resting off-screen transform); a second class,
  `.show`, is what the CSS actually keys the open transform off of
  (`.sheet-overlay.on.show .sheet`), added via a NESTED
  `requestAnimationFrame` (a single one wasn't reliably enough — its
  callback can still land before the `.on` frame has committed).
  `_overlayClose()` clears both classes together, not just `.on` — if
  `.show` were left behind, the next `_overlayOpen()` would add `.on`
  while `.show` is already present and both would flip together again,
  silently reintroducing the exact bug this works around. Verified via
  the same frame-sampling technique post-fix: one continuous monotonic
  ease from fully off-screen to rest, no stall, no jump, and repeat
  opens behave identically. If a similar "mostly smooth, then a snap"
  report ever comes up for some OTHER `display:none`-based
  show/hide-with-transition element in this app, check for this exact
  pattern first (a single class simultaneously toggling `display` and
  the transitioned property) before assuming it's a new bug.
  Follow-up once close got its own animation (see `_overlayClose`'s
  `SHEET_ANIM_MS` wait, added right after the above): `#verhist-overlay`'s
  swipe-to-dismiss gesture already animates the sheet off-screen itself
  before calling `close()`, so waiting out a SECOND, separate
  `SHEET_ANIM_MS` on top of that (the generic wait meant for the normal
  backdrop-tap/button close, where the sheet hasn't moved yet) left the
  dimmed backdrop sitting there for an extra beat after the sheet had
  already visually left — reported as "the window's gone, then a dead
  pause before you're back to the screen behind it." Fixed with an
  `instant` flag on `_overlayClose`/`VersionHistory.close` that skips
  straight to hiding when the caller already finished its own close
  animation. Any FUTURE sheet that gets its own custom pre-close
  animation (rather than just relying on `.show` removal) needs to pass
  `instant` too, for the same reason — the generic close always assumes
  it's starting the slide from scratch unless told otherwise.

- First-time users (4.16): (1) `Welcome` — full-screen `#welcome`
  (z-index 650, counts in _overlayCount like UpdateOverlay, scroll
  carve-out `.wel-body` in the sheet touchmove blocker) shown once on a
  NEW install: `DB._blank()` sets `settings.onboard:true` (existing data
  never has it; not in DEFAULT_SETTINGS, so Reset settings doesn't bring
  it back); startup opens it when set and not readOnly; "Start empty"
  (Welcome.finish) deletes it. Pages: 'install' only outside standalone
  (iOS steps if IS_IOS, else Android) → 'hello' (tabs, icons copied from
  the tab bar) → 'know' (data stays on the phone / backup; the Guide) →
  'start' (Start empty; Use a template since 4.25 — see STARTER TEMPLATES;
  AI "Coming soon", dimmed). 4.16 had a
  Menu > Guide > Welcome tour row to replay it; removed in 4.17 by request
  (to see it again for testing: `Welcome.open()` in the console, or clear
  the preview's storage). (2) `phoneLang()`: a new install (and
  Reset settings) starts in German when navigator.languages[0] starts with
  'de'; DEFAULT_SETTINGS.language stays 'en' (exports strip defaults —
  a device-dependent default would make that ambiguous). (3) Overview with
  NO project at all shows `.add-card` in `.add-block>.agrid.add-grid` (a
  project card's size, 104x117 measured) → A.newProject; the add grid is
  skipped by wireOverviewDrag (no data-cat, no pid — reordering it would
  write [null] into projectOrder). (4) Menu > Guide > War Room
  (`#p-guide-war`, in SETTINGS_SUBPAGES, back → guide). Its row icon is a
  warning triangle (4.19, option A of eight tappable samples): one white
  path, rounded triangle scaled .88 around 12,12 with the exclamation cut
  out (evenodd), so it works on any background. 4.17's hand-drawn chess
  knight was called ugly — don't bring it back.
- STARTER TEMPLATES (4.25, `TEMPLATES` + `Templates`, `#tpl-sheet-overlay`,
  z-index 660 so it opens over the welcome screens): opened from the
  welcome start page ("Use a template", `Templates.open(true)` → Welcome.
  finish() after Add) and Overview "+" > Template. Basics, Student,
  Fitness, Work & focus, Routines. Several can be ticked; a ticked one
  folds out its items (projects, habits, tracker, calendar task), each
  with its own tick (`.ics-row` labels like the calendar import — not
  .opt-row). It ONLY ADDS: an item whose name already exists (project,
  habit text, calendar text — in EITHER language, `_find`) is left out;
  a template with nothing left reads "Already added" (disabled); a Habits
  project / category of the same name is reused. Names are created in the
  current language (`[en,de]` pairs) — they're user data, not I18N. One
  template → no category; 2+ templates, or a user who already has
  categories → each template's own category (`cat`). Habits projects are
  created on their first ticked habit (the first ever becomes
  habitsProjectId). No made-up history. Basics' To-do teaches the app:
  SHORT titles (Today's rows with a badge fit ~25 characters on a 375px
  phone — "Swipe me right to skip me for today" was cut off) and the
  explanation in each task's notes. A new template needs: entry in
  TEMPLATES (sub, cat, hp map, items), unique names vs the others.
  Changing a template's wording later = old installs won't match it as
  "already there" (dedupe is by name).
- DEVELOPER MODE (4.24, "a switch… where I can test stuff… but I don't
  want everyone to see it… you need an access code"): Menu > General >
  Developer > Developer mode (`settings.devMode`, default false, in
  DEFAULT_SETTINGS). Turning it on opens InputSheet with `{secret:true}`
  (dots via -webkit-text-security, number pad; normal calls reset both)
  and compares the SHA-256 of the entry with `A._DEV_HASH` — the code
  itself is NOT in the repo (public) or this file; the user has it. Only
  a casual lock: anyone can set devMode in storage or brute-force 6
  digits offline. While on, Menu shows a Developer row (`#settings-dev`)
  → `#p-dev` (in SETTINGS_SUBPAGES): Welcome screens / Add to Home Screen
  · iPhone / · Android via `Welcome.open({install:false|'ios'|'android'})`
  (replays never touch settings.onboard). New test tools go on #p-dev.
- Calendar import (4.16, Menu > Data > Import calendar, `IcsImport`):
  file input `#ics-file` (.ics, or Google's .zip — `_unzip` reads the
  zip's central directory, stored or deflate-raw via DecompressionStream).
  `_parse` unfolds lines, skips nested blocks (VALARM), reads SUMMARY,
  DTSTART (UTC 'Z' → local day via dStr, otherwise the date as written),
  RRULE/RECURRENCE-ID (= repeating, LEFT OUT: one-time Calendar tasks
  can't represent them, and a wrong next date is worse than none), STATUS
  CANCELLED (left out). Past and already-present (text+date) events are
  left out too; the window lists the rest with a tick each (`.ics-row`
  labels — NOT .opt-row, so TAPPABLE/press-grey/hold handlers leave them
  alone) and counts what was left out; Import N → `DB.addOnceMany` (one
  save). Tested with a real Python-built Google-style zip (2 .ics + a
  txt), escapes, folding, alarms, Z times. Loop variables must not be
  called `t` — it hides the global translate t() (caught in review).
  URL / account sync (Google OAuth, iCloud) is NOT built: a static site
  can't fetch calendar URLs (CORS) without a proxy.
- Hold to complete is OFF by default since 4.15 (`DEFAULT_SETTINGS.
  holdToComplete:false`; asked for after I flagged it as the worst
  first-day trap: a new user's tap on a tick box did nothing). Existing
  users keep their stored value. Exports drop settings equal to the
  defaults, so an export made before 4.15 by someone with it ON has no
  key — `A.importData` sets it back to true when the export's
  lastSeenVersion is older than 'Beta 4.15' (CHANGELOG order).
- Hold to complete shows NO progress while holding (3.79, by request): the
  grey bar that filled under the row (`::before` driven by `.holding`/
  `.snap`) and those classes are gone; the hold still completes after
  700ms with the click sound (Menu > General > Sounds).
- The "Hold to complete tasks" gesture (global `touchstart` handler,
  search "HOLD TO COMPLETE") has its own separate completion dispatch
  from the normal tap path (a checkbox's native `onchange`) — the two
  are NOT the same code path, and it's easy to update one without
  realizing the other needs the same fix. Bit exactly this way once
  already (`.switch` inside a TAPPABLE row) and again here: a one-time
  task's row (`data-once`, in Tasks > Calendar) completes correctly via
  its checkbox's `onchange="A.completeOnce(...)"` on a normal tap, but
  the hold-gesture branch for non-`.cali` rows only checked
  `data-li` vs "anything else" and fell through to `A.done(cb)` for a
  one-time row — which reads `data-key`/`data-text`/`data-sec`, none of
  which a `data-once` row has, so it silently called
  `DB.completeTask(null,null,null)` (touches nothing in `dailyOnce`,
  just adds a bogus null-key archived entry) while still fading out and
  removing the DOM row on its own timer. Looked completed right up
  until that view next re-rendered from data that still had the item —
  reported as "ticked it off, it just reappeared again." Fixed by
  giving that branch the same three-way `data-once`/`data-li`/else
  check the `.cali` branch above it already had. If a *different*
  completable row type gets added later, grep for
  `hasAttribute('data-` in that touchstart handler and make sure the
  new type is handled in BOTH branches (`.cali` and the `.ti`/`.wri`
  one), not just wherever its own `onchange` lives.

- ROOT CAUSE of the "dead space"/strip under every sheet AND the footer
  tab bar "jumping" on close (took five rounds; four were blind guesses
  that each got reverted): on the user's iPhone (iOS, installed
  standalone PWA, 393x852) the `position:fixed` body scroll lock shrinks
  the layout viewport from 852 to 793 — exactly the 59pt top safe area —
  for as long as it's applied. `window.innerHeight` goes 852 -> 793, every
  `position:fixed` element (sheet, backdrop, tab bar) is laid out against
  the shorter viewport and stops 59pt above the physical bottom, and the
  page cannot paint into the strip below it at all (only the html
  background color shows). The tab bar jumped because it moved up when
  the lock went on and back when it came off. Found only by adding a
  TEMPORARY on-device readout (innerHeight/screen/visualViewport/vh
  units/safe-area/rects + a lock toggle) to Version history and having
  the user screenshot it with the lock on and off: lock on -> sheet
  bottom 793 + strip; lock off -> 852, no strip. When a rendering bug is
  device-only and reproduction fails in preview, ship a diagnostic like
  that after the FIRST failed guess, not the fourth.
  Fix (superseded in 3.14 — pages now scroll in their own frames and the
  lock is overflow:hidden on the active page, see that entry):
  `_lockBodyScroll` used `overflow:hidden` on `<html>` (no viewport
  change) when `navigator.standalone===true`, and kept the original
  `position:fixed` body lock everywhere else. `_lockMode` remembers which
  was applied so unlock undoes the right one. Since 2.19 a document-level non-passive `touchmove` (search "While a
  sheet is open nothing behind it may scroll") also cancels any drag that
  would scroll the page (backdrop drags, and sheet drags at a scroll
  boundary), plus `touch-action:none` on `.sheet-overlay` / `pan-y` on
  `.sheet`, because overflow:hidden on <html> alone doesn't stop touch
  scrolling on all iOS versions. Trade-off to know about:
  the fixed lock existed because it stops an already-in-flight iOS
  momentum scroll dead; `overflow:hidden` may not, so background
  scrolling coasting behind a sheet is the thing to check first if that
  old report comes back on the installed app.
  Things that did NOT help and were removed: extending the
  sheet/backdrop past the bottom edge, recoloring `<html>` to the sheet's
  color, making Version history taller. Lesson: also read an annotated
  screenshot literally — one of those guesses came from picking the
  easiest reading of a circled region.

- Switches (3.87, "laggy… when on and turning off, right at the beginning it
  bumps"): two causes. (1) Pressed while ON the knob stretches left (width
  22→27 AND translateX 20→15); width ran .2s and transform .25s, so its
  right edge poked out ~1px and came back — now both .25s, same curve, right
  edge constant (x+w=42). OFF→pressed only widens rightward, which is why
  only turning OFF bumped. (2) Every switch's onchange saved all data
  (DB.save = JSON of everything, photos included) and redrew a page inside
  the tap, delaying the knob's first frames on the phone. A document-level
  CAPTURE 'change' listener now stops a `.switch` input's change and runs
  its inline onchange SWITCH_MS (260ms) later, after the slide; rapid
  re-taps collapse into one call with the final state. New switches need
  nothing extra. Side effect to know: for those 260ms the setting isn't
  saved yet (a re-render in that window shows the old state).
- `body.kb-open` (hides the tab bar/FAB while typing) is set on focusin
  only for fields that bring up a keyboard (`_isTypingField`: textarea,
  and inputs other than checkbox/radio/range/buttons/color/file/hidden).
  It used to match any `input`: Android focuses a switch's checkbox on tap
  (iOS doesn't), so on a Samsung flipping a Settings > Menu switch hid the
  whole tab bar until leaving the page — looked like the Menu setting
  didn't apply live, while it actually had. Anything Android-only that
  "disappears until you navigate away" is worth checking against focus.

- The footer tab bar is ALWAYS visible now (it used to hide on project
  pages / Daily and while a sheet was open, with a timed show/hide dance
  around slides — all removed in 2.23 at the user's request "for now").
  Only `body.kb-open` (keyboard) hides it. Project pages therefore have the
  normal 118px bottom padding, and `TabBar.current()` decides which tab is
  lit on pages that aren't tabs. Tabs can also be switched off in Settings
  > Menu (`settings.hiddenTabs`, `TabBar.applyTabs`). If hiding is ever
  wanted again, don't resurrect the timers blindly: hiding before a slide
  looked unfinished, so it has to be deferred until the moving page covers
  the bar and shown immediately when something slides back.

- Header-button dropdowns (3.27): Overview's "+" (Category / Project) and
  Tasks' view button (Tasks / List / Calendar, current one checked) open the
  same floating list DSel uses, right under the button — `DSel.menu(btn,
  opts,cur,pick)` (the list-building/positioning part of DSel is `show()`;
  customSelect rows still go through `toggle`). They used to open AddChoice
  bottom sheets; asked for as "a normal drop down". Daily's "+" and project
  pages' "+" were not part of the request and still use their windows.
  Tab bar icons (3.60, asked for by description): Today = the tick box
  (Tasks' old icon), Overview = one rounded square split by one horizontal
  and one vertical line (was four small squares), Tasks = a list (three dots
  + lines). Stroke 1.7, outer 3.5..20.5 like the others; the Menu rows reuse
  them via `tabIco()`. The list's getBBox centre reads 11.57 because round
  line caps aren't in the bbox — with them it spans 3.5..20.5, centred.
  Project type names (TYPE_OPTS): To-do, List, Tracker, Habits (3.75, was
  "Daily" — only the name; the stored type value stays 'daily').
  Project type icons (3.33, `TYPE_ICONS`): To-do = tick box, List =
  bulleted list, Tracker = rising chart, Daily = loop — picked from mockups
  (a scale and repeat arrows were the alternatives). Shown only in the Type
  dropdown's open list: a DSel option can carry `ico` (SVG markup), drawn
  before its name (`.dsel-ico` + `.dsel-lbl`).
  Default project emoji is 📁 (3.34, was 📋) — new projects, the icon
  field's placeholder/fallbacks and `iconOrPhoto`; `DB._migrate` turns any
  existing '📋' into '📁' (it was the default, so almost never chosen).
  Project photos (3.34): a photo with see-through pixels is SAVED as a
  transparent PNG and shown over the project's color tile (`.aico`'s
  tintStyle), so a later color change shows through. Before, it was
  flattened to JPEG onto the color picked at save time (a transparent
  `photoRaw` existed only while the sheet was open), so reopening the
  sheet and picking another color changed nothing. Opaque photos are still
  small JPEGs. Photos saved before 3.34 keep their baked-in color until
  re-picked.
  Naming: "one-time tasks" (`dailyOnce`, `onceRow`, OnceAddSheet) are
  called just CALENDAR on screen everywhere since 3.58 (3.34 had "Calendar
  task(s)"): the window title, Daily's "+" entry, Daily's section, Today's
  section, Tasks' view, Trash; empty state "Nothing in the calendar yet."
  The stored archive tag stays `section:'One-time'`; code names unchanged.
  3.30: after a dropdown was closed by tapping elsewhere, the next tap on
  its button did nothing — DSel swallowed EVERY click for 450ms after an
  outside press. Now it swallows only the closing tap's own click (a click
  on the touched element or on a button containing it), within 700ms.
- DSel dropdowns (customSelect/DSel — Language, Day starts at, Tasks shown,
  Reset a project, and since 2.61 the Task window's Priority/Project rows)
  render their open list (`.dsel-menu`) as a floating element appended
  straight to `document.body`, not nested inside whatever row opened it.
  The global touchmove blocker that stops the page scrolling behind an open
  `.sheet-overlay` (search "While a sheet is open nothing behind it may
  scroll") only carved out `.sheet` itself as scrollable — so a DSel menu
  opened from a row THAT LIVES INSIDE an already-open sheet (exactly what
  the Task window's Priority/Project rows do) got every touchmove inside
  it treated as background scroll and blocked outright: reported as "the
  dropdown doesn't work, I can't scroll." DSel dropdowns opened from a
  Settings page never hit this, because no `.sheet-overlay` is open there
  (`_overlayCount` is 0) and the blocker returns immediately. Fixed by
  adding `.dsel-menu` to that blocker's carve-out alongside `.sheet`. If a
  future floating element (another menu/popover appended to body rather
  than nested in the sheet) needs to scroll while opened from inside a
  sheet, it needs the same carve-out, not a new one-off case.
  3.45: DSel closes on scroll (capture listener) — but only for real
  scrollers (a page/sheet). Scroll events of the document itself are
  ignored: since 3.14 the document never scrolls, so they're iOS's
  rubber-band bounce. A drag that slid off an open dropdown bounced the
  document, closed the list, and the bounce still settling closed the list
  again right after it was reopened. `html` also has overscroll-behavior:none.

- iOS: a `position:fixed` sheet is anchored to the LAYOUT viewport, which
  does NOT shrink when the on-screen keyboard opens — only the VISUAL
  viewport does. From iOS's point of view a sheet sitting at `bottom:0`
  is now BEHIND the keyboard, so it auto-scrolls the whole document to
  bring the focused input back into view — and because fixed positioning
  on iOS tracks that same scroll instead of staying put, the sheet AND
  the page behind it visibly jump together. Reported as "it's not just
  the edit window that moves, the background does too." This is the
  same root cause as the tab bar/FAB hiding while typing (see the
  comment right above this fix) — just with an interactive sheet, which
  can't simply be hidden. Fixed (2.73) by tracking `window.visualViewport`
  directly and lifting the open sheet by the keyboard's height via an
  inline `bottom` style (composes fine with the existing open/close slide,
  which only ever touches `transform`) — once the sheet already sits
  right above the keyboard, iOS has no remaining reason to auto-scroll
  the document, so the background stops moving too. Reset on `focusout`.
  Only verified with a simulated `visualViewport` resize in this desktop
  preview (there's no real virtual keyboard here) — this is the standard
  fix for this well-documented WebKit behavior, but still needs
  confirming on a real iPhone; if it's not enough there, the next thing
  to check is whether `visualViewport.offsetTop` is actually nonzero
  during the real keyboard animation (it's assumed to track any residual
  page scroll) rather than guessing at more one-off timers.
  2.96 — reported: Android pushed tall sheets (New project) past the top
  of the screen, and on iPhone the background still moved. Causes: (1)
  nothing capped the sheet to the VISIBLE height — a 75vh/88vh sheet
  (vh = the full screen) lifted above the keyboard, or placed in an
  Android layout viewport the keyboard had already shrunk, simply didn't
  fit; (2) the lift only happened after the keyboard animation, by which
  time iOS had already panned the page up to reveal the field, and
  nothing undid that pan. Now ("must track the KEYBOARD"): while a typing
  field in a sheet has focus, the sheet gets `.kb` + `--kbvh` (max-height
  = visible height - top safe area - 12px, beats per-sheet max-heights
  with !important) and the focused field is scrolled into view inside
  it; any visual-viewport pan (offsetTop>0) is scrolled back to the
  locked position; and on iOS the sheet is lifted by the last measured
  keyboard height (localStorage 'lifeos-kb', else 40% of the screen)
  BEFORE the field focuses. 2.96 did that lift on touchstart — the
  background stopped moving, but the keyboard never opened: moving the
  field out from under the finger mid-tap makes iOS drop the tap, so the
  field never got focus. 2.97 takes the tap over instead: on touchend of
  a real tap (no >10px move) on a text field in a sheet, with no field
  focused yet, it preventDefault()s the native focus, lifts the sheet,
  and calls `field.focus({preventScroll:true})` itself — still inside the
  touch gesture, which is what lets iOS open the keyboard. Text fields
  only (date/time open pickers); a tap on an already-focused field stays
  native (caret placement); undone after 600ms if no focus followed.
  General lesson: never move/restyle the element under the finger between
  touchstart and touchend on iOS if the tap itself must still work.
  The lift formula (innerHeight - vv.height - vv.offsetTop) already gives
  0 on an Android that shrinks the layout viewport itself, so Android only
  gets the height cap. Verified by overriding visualViewport.height/
  offsetTop in the preview; whether the iOS pre-lift fully stops the pan
  needs the real phone — if it doesn't, ship an on-device readout of
  innerHeight/vv.height/vv.offsetTop/scrollY during focus (see the
  "dead space" entry) before guessing again.
  3.10 — the lift itself was the problem: "it looks best if nothing moves
  and the keyboard goes over everything", plus "make all the input windows
  high enough so it doesn't cover them". The lift, the `.kb`/`--kbvh`
  height cap and the iOS pre-lift are gone. Now `KbFit.fit(sheet)` runs in
  `_overlayOpen` (before the slide-up, and again one frame later) for any
  sheet with a text field and sets its `height` so every visible text field
  (a tall notes box: its first 88px) ends 16px above the predicted keyboard
  top, including the first `.sheet-save` when that still fits; capped at
  screen - top safe area - 12px. Predicted keyboard = largest measured
  (`lifeos-kb`, only ever raised; iOS number pad is shorter than the text
  keyboard) or 46% of the screen. A MutationObserver re-fits (grow only)
  when an open sheet's content changes. While typing, the sheet gets extra
  bottom padding for the covered part so a field that still can't fit
  (New project's emoji/Window size) is scrolled up INSIDE it; on iOS that
  scroll happens in the tap takeover before focus (only for such fields —
  fields above the line get a plain native tap). Android: viewport meta
  has `interactive-widget=resizes-visual`, and if the layout viewport still
  shrinks, the sheet gets a negative `bottom` so it stays put. Verified with
  an overridden visualViewport.height in the preview; the real keyboard
  height and iOS's pan behavior need the phone.
  3.16 — reported: "when the keyboard opens the whole app bumps up and
  down". Read as: iOS slides the view (visual viewport offsetTop) to reveal
  the natively-focused field — even one already above the keyboard — and
  sync()'s scrollTo(0,0) snaps it back = up then down. 3.10 had narrowed
  the iOS tap takeover to fields the keyboard would cover; now EVERY first
  tap on a text field in a sheet is taken over again (preventDefault on
  touchend, focus({preventScroll:true}) inside the tap; covered fields are
  also scrolled up inside the sheet first), and every sheet's auto-focus
  (`setTimeout(...focus...,300)`) uses preventScroll. Unconfirmed on the
  phone, so `KbDiag` records the last keyboard opening (max offsetTop =
  "view slid", innerHeight before/after, keyboard height, 'tap' = takeover
  or 'native') in 'lifeos-kbdiag' and Settings > App shows it as a small
  "Keyboard check" line. If the bump persists, read that line off the
  phone before changing anything: slid>0 with 'tap' = preventScroll isn't
  enough on iOS; page height changing = the layout viewport resizes (then
  sync's negative `bottom` is what moves). Removed in 3.47 after the phone
  showed "view slid 0px · page 852→852 · switch · iOS 18.1" — settled.
  3.19 — confirmed on the phone: the first tap no longer bumps, but tapping
  from one field to ANOTHER still did (it was left native). The takeover now
  covers any tap on a text field that isn't the one already focused ('switch'
  in KbDiag; the "covered?" line uses the real visible bottom when the
  keyboard is up), and puts the caret at the end of the field's text
  (setSelectionRange in try/catch — number inputs throw). A tap on the
  focused field itself stays native so the caret can still be placed.
  Also by request: no word suggestions/autocorrect anywhere — `_noSuggest`
  sets autocomplete=off, autocorrect=off, spellcheck=false on every typing
  field (at load, and on touchstart/focusin for fields rendered later). iOS
  may still show an empty or AutoFill-only bar above the keyboard; pages
  can't remove that bar entirely.
  3.30 — still bumped when creating a category: windows that focus their
  field by themselves (InputSheet, new task/habit/one-time/tracker value)
  did so from a 300ms timer; on iOS that puts focus in the field WITHOUT
  opening the keyboard, so the user's tap was "on the focused field" and
  left native -> iOS slid the view. Now `_autoFocus` skips iOS (`IS_IOS`,
  shared with the keyboard IIFE), and the takeover also handles a focused
  field whose keyboard isn't up (`kbUp()`; it blurs and re-focuses so the
  keyboard opens).

- A single wrong CHANGELOG string (2.85) silently broke the ENTIRE app —
  worth internalizing exactly how, since nothing about it looked wrong at
  a glance and it slipped past writing the edit AND a first look at the
  diff. A changelog line was written as `'...when you\\'re pressing...'`
  — double backslash before the apostrophe. In the tool call that WROTE
  it, that was meant to produce a single escaped `\'` in the file; instead
  it put a literal `\\'` into the file — an escaped backslash (`\\`,
  a real backslash character) immediately followed by an UNescaped `'`,
  which closes the string right there. Everything after that point in the
  array literal is now bare, invalid tokens, so the whole (single, giant)
  `<script>` tag fails to parse — and since it's one classic script, not a
  module, a parse failure anywhere in it means NONE of it runs, not just
  the broken part. Every top-level `var` stays hoisted-but-`undefined`
  (`DB`, `A`, `APP_VERSION`, all of it) — so the page still LOOKS fine
  (HTML+CSS render normally, tab bar and all) but every screen is empty
  and every interaction does nothing, because there is, functionally, no
  app running at all. Console logging didn't surface this in the tool
  used to check it — `read_console_messages` came back empty even with no
  filter — so absence of a logged error is NOT proof the script loaded.
  What actually caught it: `typeof APP_VERSION` (or any top-level var)
  coming back `"undefined"` after a fresh load, and `new Function(document
  .scripts[0].textContent)` to get a real `SyntaxError` with a message to
  grep for (`grep -n "\\\\'" index.html` immediately found both broken
  lines — the actual fix search that worked). The general lesson: after
  ANY edit that adds a JS string with an apostrophe via escaping, verify
  by loading the page fresh and checking that a top-level global is
  actually defined — a page that "looks right" (renders its static shell)
  is not proof the script executed; only a defined global proves it did.

- BETA 4.0 SHIPPED BROKEN (the app didn't start at all; "the whole app is
  not loading and the menu bar is not responsive" — the user has a lot of
  data on it). Cause: a LAST-MINUTE reword of a CHANGELOG line added
  "aren't" inside a single-quoted JS string; the preview had been checked
  BEFORE that edit and not reloaded after it. Same class as the 2.85 bug
  below. Data was safe (a script that never runs writes nothing). Guards
  now, all of them required:
  1. `.git/hooks/pre-commit` (local, not in the repo — recreate it from
     this note if the clone is new): extracts every <script> block of the
     STAGED index.html plus sw.js and parses them with Safari's own engine,
     `/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaScriptCore.framework/Versions/A/
     Helpers/jsc -e "new Function(readFile(f))"`; any failure blocks the
     commit. Tested: it refuses the broken 4.0. Never bypass it (--no-verify).
  2. After the LAST edit of a change, fresh-load the preview and check
     `typeof APP_VERSION` / `window.APP_OK` — not after an earlier edit.
  3. Apostrophes in JS strings: write `\'` (Python: `\\'` in a normal
     string) or use double-quoted JS strings. grep new CHANGELOG/USER_LOG
     lines for a bare ' before committing.
  Self-healing added in 4.1 (tested end to end in a throwaway folder: a
  page stuck on the broken 4.0 reloaded itself into 4.1 ~2s after the
  worker update, with nothing touched):
  - sw.js `reloadStuckPages()` on activate: pings every open page; working
    pages (4.1+) answer (`lifeos-ping` responder right after 'use strict'
    in index.html), a page that doesn't answer in 2s gets
    `client.navigate()` = reloaded into the new version. iOS checks sw.js
    on every app launch, so a broken release is healed by the next fix
    without the user doing anything (worst case: close and reopen).
  - A second, tiny `<script>` at the end of the page: if `window.APP_OK`
    (set first thing in the main script) isn't set, the main script didn't
    start → shows "Updating to a working version…", runs reg.update() and
    reloads, max 6 times per launch (sessionStorage 'lifeos-heal', cleared
    by a working start), then "couldn't start, your data is safe". Keep it
    tiny and plain ES5; it must never touch localStorage.

## Definition of "done" for a change
0. If index.html (or any other cached asset) changed, bump `CACHE_NAME` in
   sw.js — EVERY time, even for changes that have nothing to do with the
   service worker. The update check only diffs sw.js's own bytes; if it's
   unchanged, "Check for updates" truthfully-but-uselessly reports
   "already on the latest version" while the actual app content served
   stays stale. Got bitten by this exact bug once already — don't skip it.
0b. Also bump `APP_VERSION` in index.html (Beta 1.0 → 1.1 → 1.2 …) and add
    a matching entry to `CHANGELOG` for any user-visible change, so the
    "What's new" sheet has something real to show after the update lands.
    AND a `USER_LOG` entry for the same version (see "Two update logs"):
    'bug' / 'design' / 'both' for fixes, or plain-language lines when it's
    a real new feature.
0c. The pre-commit hook must pass (Safari-engine parse of every script).
    Fresh-load the preview AFTER THE LAST EDIT and confirm
    `typeof APP_VERSION === 'string'` before committing.
1. No console errors on load or on interaction with the changed feature
2. Existing features still work (see smoke-test.js — run it after every change)
3. Screenshot review of the changed UI state looks correct (no layout
   breakage, elements not misaligned/overlapping)
4. Only THEN report back for human review of feel/interaction quality
   (swipe smoothness, gesture responsiveness, animation timing — these
   require human judgment, don't guess)

## Handling vague "feel" feedback
When the human gives vague interaction feedback (e.g. "the swiping feels
off", "the animation feels weird", "the scroll feels wrong") — DO NOT
guess and make a change. Instead, respond with a short table of the most
likely specific causes for that feature, so the human can just point at
one instead of having to articulate it themselves. Cover the standard
categories:
- Sensitivity/threshold (triggers too easily / too hard to trigger)
- Responsiveness/latency (delay between input and visible reaction)
- Motion quality (snap-back speed, easing, momentum, abruptness)
- Visual feedback during the interaction (does it track the finger/cursor
  live, or only react at the end)
- Direction/axis sensitivity (wrong gesture triggering it)
- Timing relative to other animations (feels like it's fighting something
  else on screen)

Once the human picks one (or names it directly if they already know),
translate it into the specific parameter/code change and make it — don't
ask them to also specify the technical fix.

## When to stop and ask instead of continuing to iterate
- Same error persists after 3-4 different fix attempts
- The fix requires a product/design decision, not a technical one
- A change would touch shared/global components with unclear blast radius
- Anything involving credentials, API keys, or payment integration
